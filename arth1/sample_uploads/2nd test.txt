the Commission’s emphasis is on putting in place an effective mechanism
to fight corruption and bring about fair play and transparency.
(Para 1.5)
• The Commission, fully aware of the hope and expectations from it as a statutory

administration in combating corruption.
(Para 2.1)
• The Commission holds the view that time−bound action, resulting in
effective punitive action against officials found guilty of misconduct, would

measures include identification and plugging systemic loopholes through
structural remedies and improvement in processes. These measures not only
pre−empt corrupt practices and misconducts but also enhance organizational
efficiency. Standardization, automation, leveraging technology, reducing
discretion and human interface, simplification of rules and procedures,
transparency, accountability, training, and awareness are important tools of
preventive vigilance.
(Para 7.1)

vigilance.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 9
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
1.1 During a debate in Parliament in June 1962, many Members of Parliament
expressed concern at the growing menace of corruption in administration. In
pursuance of the reply to the debate given by Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, the then
Hon'ble Minister for Home Affairs, a committee on 'Prevention of Corruption'
was set up to review the existing instruments for checking corruption in central
government organisations and to advise practical steps that should be taken
to make anti−corruption measures more effective. The committee came to be
known as the 'Santhanam Committee', as it was formed under the Chairmanship
of Shri K. Santhanam, the then Member of Parliament.
The Committee observed that major causes of corruption were: −
(i) Administrative delays;
(ii) Governments taking upon themselves more than what they can manage by
way of regulatory functions;
(iii) Scope for personal discretion in the exercise of powers vested in different
categories of govt. servants; and
(iv) Cumbersome procedures of dealing with various matters which are of
importance to citizens in their day to day affairs.
1.2 While recognizing the limitations of the existing vigilance arrangements to deal
with corrupt activities by public servants and the conspicuous absence of a
dynamic integration between the vigilance units in the various Ministries and
the Administrative Vigilance Division, the Committee observed that “at present,
there is no organic relation between the Administrative Vigilance Division and
the Vigilance Officers of the various departments. We understand that in some
of the departments the Vigilance Officers are taking a keen interest in their work
while in others they do not take their responsibilities in this matter seriously.
It is also essential to evolve or apply common standards in matters relating to
prosecution, departmental action, and the award of punishment. The Committee
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
10 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
feels that the time has come to put the entire Vigilance Organisation on a proper
and adequate basis without in any way undermining the general principle that
the Secretaries and Heads of Departments are primarily responsible for the
purity, integrity, and efficiency of their departments”.
1.3 Thus, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) came into existence in 1964, as
an apex body, through the Government of India Resolution of 11.02.1964. The
establishment of the Commission was considered essential for evolving and
applying common standards in deciding cases involving lack of probity and
integrity in public life.
PRESENT STATUS
1.4 In the wake of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in 1997,
in the Writ Petition filed in public interest by Shri Vineet Narain and others in
the Hawala Case, the Government promulgated an Ordinance in 1998. The
Ordinance of 1998 conferred statutory status on the CVC and the powers to
exercise superintendence over the functioning of the Delhi Special Police
Establishment and to review the progress of the investigations pertaining to the
alleged offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, being carried out
by them. The Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha in 1998 to replace the Ordinance
could not be passed. The Bill was reintroduced in 1999 and was referred to the
Joint Committee of both the Houses of Parliament. Pending passage of the CVC
Bill, the Commission discharged its functions under the GOI Resolution dated
April 4, 1999. After the Bill was passed by both the Houses of Parliament and
with the assent of the President, the CVC Act, 2003 has come into force with
effect from 11.09.2003.
RELEVANCE OF CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
1.5 The Central Vigilance Commission being the statutory body oversees and
supervises the vigilance administration of the organisations owned or controlled
by Union of India and covered under the advisory jurisdiction of the Commission.
As an institution, Central Vigilance Commission has evolved in the last 60 years

relating to overseeing vigilance administration, the Commission's emphasis is on
putting in place an effective mechanism to fight corruption and bring about fair
play and transparency.
 1.6 Efficient vigilance administration, with its aim of transparent, ethical, objective,
accountable and responsive system of governance would ensure effective anti−
corruption and preventive measures, thereby eliminating the possibility of
indulging in corrupt and unfair practices by government servants.
1.7 As a result of increased awareness among the citizens who are users of public
services, the Central Vigilance Commission has come under greater focus as
statutory body, which can contribute significantly to eradicating corruption and
bringing about transparency and objectivity in the conduct of public servants.
The Commission, fully aware of the hope and expectations from it as statutory
body responsible for eradicating corruption from public life, is exercising its
mandate under the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (CVC Act, 2003), to
achieve the aim of making the system efficient, transparent, and accountable.

advise the organisation to establish effective preventive systems and procedures
and periodically monitor their compliance, to minimise scope for malpractices.
1.30 On the punitive side, the CVOs are required to ensure speedy processing of
vigilance and disciplinary cases. The CVC calls for Quarterly Performance Report,
which is an integral part of the reporting by CVO on the vigilance functions in the
organisation. The CVC also conducts periodic meetings to review the vigilance
related performance of the organisations and to bring the organisations on
board in addressing vigilance concerns and devising common strategies to
promote transparency, probity, efficiency, accountability, objectivity, equity, and
competitiveness in functioning of the respective organisations.

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
2.1 In order to tackle the menace of corruption and to make the system of
administration transparent, objective, and accountable, the Commission has
adopted a multi−pronged strategy. This includes measures for punitive vigilance,
preventive vigilance, and participative vigilance. These strategies complement
each other in the overall framework of vigilance administration for combating
corruption.
COMPLAINT HANDLING MECHANISM
2.2 The Commission is of the firm opinion that involvement of all stakeholders and
their active participation is essential for elimination of corruption from the
society. With a view to ensure common man’s effective participation in the fight
against corruption, the Commission has developed a well-structured Complaint
Handling Policy (CHP) as part of its robust framework for addressing complaints.
The CHP enables the complainant to lodge formal and bona−fide complaints in
respect of acts of irregularities noticed by them in Central Govt. Departments/
PSUs etc. on which the Commission takes expeditious action. CHP is available on
the Commission’s website 1
.
2.3 Under the provisions contained in section 8(1) (c) and 8(1) (d) of the CVC Act,
2003, the Commission is mandated to receive complaints and inquire or cause an
inquiry or investigation into such complaints. The Commission, on examination
of such complaints on merit, seeks investigation report or action taken report
from the CVO of the organisation concerned. As part of its complaint handling
policy, time limits for action to be taken on complaints have been specified. The
same has been done to ensure that the whole process is not only transparent
but is also fair to all the stakeholders.
2.4 A Complaint Management System (CMS) portal has been put in place to
process the complaints and to ensure that the complainant is able to know the
status of their complaint on real time basis.

CHAPTER 2
COMMISSION’S ACTIVITIES AND FOCUS AREAS
24 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
2.5 Apart from the general complaints made by any person/ organisation, the
Commission is also authorized to receive and act on complaints from whistle−
blowers, under the provisions of Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of
Informers (PIDPI) Resolution, 2004. The main difference between a general
complaint and a complaint made under the provisions of PIDPI Resolution is
that whistle-blowers making complaint(s) under the PIDPI Resolution are
entitled to confidentiality regarding their identity unless they choose to disclose
it themselves.
2.6 In accordance with the provisions contained under section 8 (1) (g) and 8 (1)
(h) of the CVC Act, 2003, the Commission tenders advice in matters as may be
referred to it by the Central Governemnt, corporation established by or under
any Central Act, Government companies, societies and local authorities owned
or controlled by the Central Government and exercises superintendence over
vigilance administration of organisations covered under its jurisdiction. The
categories of officers, covered under the jurisdiction of the Commission for the
purpose of tendering advice, are defined under section 8 (2) of CVC Act, 2003. In
respect of organisations covered under the Commission’s advisory jurisdiction,
it conducts review meetings to expedite pending complaints and cases, calls for
required reports and returns at periodical intervals. In addition, the Commission
based on the inputs available to it, issues guidelines on various aspects of vigilance
administration, including advising systemic improvements, as may be required
to stop recurrence of irregularities in any organization. As a part of punitive
vigilance functions, the Commission advises appropriate disciplinary action
for misconducts noticed on the part of officials concerned. The Commission’s
main objective is to establish a mechanism for effective vigilance administration,
which helps in promoting probity, transparency and good governance in the
organisations.
PUNITIVE VIGILANCE
2.7 It cannot be over-emphasized that time−bound action, resulting in effective
punitive action against those found guilty of misconduct, would act as a
deterrent for others and would dissuade them from committing any intentional
misconduct. The Commission is also of the view that completion of investigations
and disciplinary proceedings in a timely manner is in the interest of the
organization and the employee. Therefore, emphasizing the need for timely
action in disciplinary matters, appropriate guidelines have been issued by the
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 25
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Commission from time to time to adhere to the prescribed time lines in all
disciplinary cases.
PREVENTIVE VIGILANCE
2.8 The preventive vigilance vertical of vigilance administration seeks to achieve
corruption free governance proactively, by proposing structural remedies, which
would minimize the possibility of corrupt practices. Although potential areas
of corruption are specific to organisations/sectors, there are some broad areas
common to all organisations, such as procurement, sale of goods and services,
allocation of scarce resources, human resource management, delivery of services
important to a common man and effective grievance redressal mechanism, etc.
which need attention.
2.9 The measures advocated by the Commission to ensure an effective preventive
vigilance mechanism include simplification/up−dation of rules, leveraging
technology as a tool for transparency and objectivity, re−engineering of processes,
regular and effective inspections to ensure accountability, rotational transfer of
officials, training/capacity building measures and ensuring participation of all
stake holders by creating awareness among them.
PARTICIPATIVE VIGILANCE
2.10 Participative vigilance is also being emphasized by the Commission as an
important tool to ensure active engagement of all stakeholders, the culmination
of which is the observance of Vigilance Awareness Week (VAW), every year.
VAW coincides with the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first
Home Minister of independent India. In the year 2024, VAW was observed from
28.10.2024 to 03.11.2024, with the theme “Culture of Integrity for Nation’s
Prosperity”. Large scale participation by government functionaries, civil society
organisations, eminent persons from private sectors and educational institutions,
including many students was observed across the country.
2.11 Details of activities undertaken by the Commission, Central Government
organisations, Public Sector Undertakings, Banks and other stake holders, as a
run up to and during the Vigilance Awareness Week, 2024 are given in Chapter−8
of this report.
26 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING
2.12 Capacity building in the Commission is a planned and continuous process. It
seeks to impart knowledge and improve skills in consonance with the learning
and development needs of a role holder. The training needs of each role holder
are identified in the capacity building plan of the Commission and training
interventions are provided to build role specific competencies. As part of this
endeavor, the Commission conducts training programmes such as induction, midcareer and thematic training programmes on public procurement, preventive
forensics, preparation of chargesheet and IO/PO training for CVOs as well as other
vigilance functionaries under the jurisdiction of the Commission. In addition to
conducting training in physical mode, the Commission is also onboarded on
iGOT platform of the Mission Karmayogi. A repository of relevant iGOT courses
has been created and competency-wise relevant courses are mapped to each
designation in the Commission.
2.13 Further, as a part of its ongoing efforts to enhance stakeholders understanding
of vigilance related issues, the Commission has uploaded a series of audio-visual
training modules on its website www.cvc.gov.in. Detailed information about
activities in the field of capacity building is provided in Chapter−9 of this report.
RECEIPT AND DISPOSAL OF VIGILANCE CASES
2.14 The Commission received 2999 number of cases (including 706 cases carried
forward from 2023) and tendered its advice in 2603 number of cases in 2024.

that in respect of those cases where the Disciplinary Authority (DA), on
conclusion of disciplinary proceedings proposed to impose a penalty in line with
the Commission’s first stage advice, the Commission was not required to be
consulted for second stage advice. It has resulted in expeditious conclusion of
disciplinary matters by the authorities concerned in the respective organisations.
Cases disposed of by the Commission include advice tendered as first stage
advice and second stage advice, in addition to advice for sanction for prosecution.

they provide actionable inputs about malpractices in any organisation. In the
Commission, complaints can be lodged either through a written communication
or through the Complaint Management System Portal2
, a link to which is available
on Commission’s website.
2.27 The Commission has formulated a comprehensive complaint handling policy,
which has evolved over a period of time and provides information to the stake
holders about the manner in which complaints are to be lodged with the
Commission and the procedure for processing of complaints in the Commission.
As a proactive measure, the complaint handling policy has been uploaded
on Commission’s website and is available in public domain, in downloadable
form. After due scrutiny and in accordance with the procedure prescribed in
the complaint handling policy, the complaints containing specific and verifiable
allegations having vigilance angle are forwarded to the CVOs concerned for
conducting investigation and submitting report to the Commission. As per
the prescribed timelines, the organisation concerned is required to complete
investigation within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the
complaint by them.
2.28 As per the provisions contained under section 17 of CVC Act, 2003, the Ministries/
Departments /Organisations are required to furnish report of the investigation/
inquiry undertaken by them on a reference made by the Commission. The

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
CHAPTER 3
SUPERINTENDENCE OVER
VIGILANCE ADMINISTRATION
3.1 The Central Vigilance Commission, as per the provisions contained under Section
8 (1) (h) of CVC Act, 2003, is mandated to exercise superintendence over the
vigilance administration of the various Ministries of the Central Government or
corporations established by or under any Central Act, Government companies,
societies and local authorities owned or controlled by the Central Government.
VIGILANCE ADMINISTRATION IN ORGANIZATIONS
3.2 Vigilance Administration in any organization is an integral part of public
administration with an objective to make the system of governance transparent,
objective, accountable, responsive and answerable to the common citizens of the
country. In any organization, the responsibility of ensuring an effective vigilance
administration in an organization primarily lies with the Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) of the organization. In order to provide expert advice and assistance to
the CEOs in vigilance related matters, every organization has a vigilance unit,
which is headed by the Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) who acts as Advisor to the
CEO of the organization in such matters. It is expected of the CEO to consider the
systemic measures and inputs provided by the CVO, for implementation to ensure
probity, transparency, and objectivity in the functioning of the organization.
3.3 The CVO functions as an extended arm of the Central Vigilance Commission.
Any vigilance function should aim at upholding the morale of the officials and
protecting the value system of the organisation. The CEO is expected to diligently
review the vigilance work and consider the inputs provided by the CVO for better
management of the institution by promoting ethical behavior in its functioning.
3.4 The CVO is also the nodal officer of the organization for interaction with CVC
and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The vigilance functions performed by
the CVO includes collecting intelligence about the corrupt practices committed,
or likely to be committed by the employees of the organisation or others;
investigating or causing investigations to be made into verifiable allegations
44 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
reported to them; processing investigation reports for further consideration of
the disciplinary authority; referring the matters to the Commission for advice
wherever necessary; taking steps to prevent improper practices and commission
of misconducts; examining audit/inspection and other reports from the vigilance
angle, etc. Though there are several facets of vigilance, yet preventive vigilance
measures taken by the CVOs are of substantial significance in reducing the
occurrence of vigilance cases.
3.5 The CVO constitutes an important link between the organisation and the Central
Vigilance Commission. The Commission communicates primarily with the CVO
while tendering advice and seeking reports, clarifications, etc.
3.6 Punitive vigilance functions of CVOs are also of significance. The same would
consist of investigation into acts of irregular conduct by employees of the
organisation concerned, as noticed by him, and recommend appropriate action
for misconduct surfaced during investigation. They are also required to ensure
proper framing of article of charges, timely finalization of inquiry proceedings,
to ensure that advice of CVC or other authorities concerned is obtained in
disciplinary proceedings/criminal proceedings. The functions of the CVOs in
the respective organizations cover a whole gamut of activities, covering wide
spectrum.
APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF VIGILANCE OFFICERS (CVOs)
 3.7 As stated above, the CVOs assist the Heads of the Department/Organization
in all vigilance matters. Presently, there are total 190 ministries/departments/
central public sector enterprises and other organizations where the post of CVO
is on full time basis. Appointment of CVOs in 153 of these organizations is done
by DOPT in terms of its OM No. 40/1/2022-EO(CVO) dated 18.11.2022, after
obtaining clearance from the Commission. Besides this, in Public Sector Banks/
Insurance Companies/ Financial Institutions, CVOs are appointed by Department
of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance. Similarly, CVOs of local bodies e.g.
New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD)
and Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) etc. are appointed by Ministry of Home
Affairs. In a few Ministries/Departments viz., CBDT, CBIC, Department of Posts,
and Ministry of Railways, there are encadred posts of full-time CVO.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 45
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
3.8 As the Commission carries out its mandate of superintendence over vigilance
administration through the CVOs, it has significant role in empanelment
of officers and their appointment as full-time CVOs in these organizations.
Commission’s approval is a necessary requirement for empanelment of an
officer for consideration as CVO in any organization.
3.9 In case, scale of operation of a particular organization does not justify having a
full time CVO, an officer within the organization, sufficiently senior in rank to be
able to report directly to the Chief Executive for vigilance matters, is considered
for appointment as part-time CVO in that organization. The Commission
approves name of a suitable officer for appointment as part-time CVO, out of the
panel proposed by the concerned ministries/departments/autonomous bodies
concerned. In this regard, the Commission has issued circular No. 022-CVO-08
dated 21.03.2022 defining the procedure for appointment of part time CVOs.
3.10 During the year 2024, the Commission approved the names of 123 officers
for empanelment for consideration as full time Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs).
The Commision approved names of 3 officers for appointment as CVO on full
time basis in specific organizations. The Commission also approved names of
61 officers for assigning them additional charge of CVO in other organizations.
In addition, names of 141 officers were approved for appointment as part-time
CVOs in various ministries/departments/autonomous bodies. The Commission
has advised the respective organisations to fill up all vacant posts of CVOs
promptly.
PERFORMANCE OF CHIEF VIGILANCE OFFICERS
3.11 The Commission communicates its advice and guidelines on various aspects of
vigilance administration through the CVO. Reports, clarifications, and any other
information as may be required by the Commission for effective supervision over
vigilance administration is also sought through the CVO. CVO is also responsible
for bringing to the Commission’s notice any flaw in the implementation of
guidelines issued by the Commission.
3.12 In accordance with the provisions of CVC Act, 2003, the Commission tenders
advice to the organizations concerned, about appropriate punitive/preventive
or corrective action, as the case may be, in an objective manner, based on
the material available. Action on Commission’s advice is to be taken by the
46 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
competent authority and in case where the competent authority deviates from
the Commission’s advice, the CVO has the responsibility to bring the same to the
notice of the Commission.
3.13 The Commission monitors the performance of CVOs through well-established
mechanisms of scrutiny of quarterly performance reports, annual reports and
periodic reviews conducted by the Commission in sectoral/zonal meetings. The
Commission also reviews the work of CVOs from time to time and reconciles
pending issues invariably before Annual Sectoral Review Meetings. The Secretary
and the Additional Secretaries in the Commission also review the pending cases
with CVOs from time to time. The CVOs of Ministries/Departments/organizations
are required to submit annual reports of vigilance activities pertaining to their
organizations to the Commission. The performance of the CVOs for the year 2024,
as per information provided in these annual reports, is reflected in Appendix III
(A to G).
3.14 With a view to prevent harassment of CVOs and protect their functional
autonomy, all complaints against them are referred to the Commission for
advice. To prevent victimization of officials (other than the CVOs) working in
the vigilance set up of any organisation, instructions/guidelines have also been
issued vide Commission’s circular no. 16/3/06 dated 28.03.2006 defining steps
for their protection.
3.15 The Commission has a dedicated portal through which any complainant can
lodge an online complaint by following the prescribed procedure. The complaints
received physically are also uploaded on the portal. All the complaints are
scrutinized thoroughly and an appropriate decision on each complaint is taken,
in accordance with the Commission’s Complaint Handling Policy, which has
evolved over a period of time. At the end of the year 2024, the Commission

vigilance administration (Circular No.02/02/24 issued vide Letter No.000/
VGL/018 dated 13.02.2024). Commission emphasizes timely completion
of departmental inquiry proceedings. It is observed that one of the
reasons for delay in departmental inquiry is frequent change of Inquiry
Officer (IO) as a result of transfer, promotion, retirement etc. of the earlier
IO. Vide this circular, Commission has advised all the organizations that
the same IO should continue inquiry, even after his transfer or promotion,
till the inquiry report is submitted by him. It is also emphasized in the
circular that a person who is due to retire shortly may not be appointed as
IO. In case, the departmental inquiry gets delayed due to any reason and
the IO retires before submission of inquiry report, he may be considered

(b) Considering petition of bias by Charged Officers (Circular No.03/02/24
issued vide Letter No. 023/VGL/120 dated 19.02.2024). Commission has
observed that one of the reasons for delay in disciplinary proceeding is

raise issues of bias against the Inquiry Officer (IO) and inquiry proceedings
are stayed till the disposal of bias petition by the Competent Authority. It
was observed that as per rule 22 (iii) of CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965 and Rule 15

the shortage was a meagre 1.86% (within permissible limit) in the Annual Coal
Stock measurement report for the year 2018 conducted in the first week of
April 2018. The reduction in shortage was due to underreporting of coal being
transported to coal stockyard. The actions of the officers of MCL were in violation
of the guidelines for maintaining the coal stock as per CIL’s Revised Yellow Book,
2012 and may lead to unaccounted pilferage of coal causing financial loss to the
company.

to relax the eligibility conditions for certain candidates during the recruitment
process, despite the presence of a sufficient number of eligible candidates.
Furthermore, the quota for permanent employees was exceeded when granting
absorptions with relaxed eligibility criteria and the EESL Board was not informed
of these actions. The relaxation of requirements seems to extend advantage to
certain internal candidates, while disregarding a considerable number of eligible
candidates, thereby undermining the transparency of the entire recruitment
process. However, the Disciplinary Authority imposed minor penalty on the then
EVC(EESL), CGM(Tech.) EESL and two Senior Managers on the charges leveled

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 79
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
BACKGROUND
5.1 The Chief Technical Examiners’ Organisation (CTEO) was established in the
year 1957 under the erstwhile Ministry of Works, Housing and Supply, which is
today known as Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The mandate of CTEO
was to conduct technical audit of works undertaken by the Central Public Works
Department (CPWD), with the objective of achieving economy in expenditure
and better technical and financial control.
5.2 The Committee on ‘Prevention of Corruption’, known as Santhanam Committee,
while appreciating the contribution of CTEO, recommended for strengthening it
so as to make it more effective. It also recommended enlarging the jurisdiction of
CTEO to cover construction works undertaken by other Ministries/Departments
and to place it under administrative control of the Central Vigilance Commission.
On acceptance of these recommendations by the Government, CTEO was placed
under the administrative control of the Commission in the year 1964.
5.3 The CTEO initially undertook intensive examination of selected civil and electrical
construction works only. Subsequently, with the increasing expenditure on
purchase of goods, services etc., CTEO began conducting intensive examination
of supply and service contracts as well. At present, CTEO conducts intensive
examinations of all contractual activities of the Central Government, Central
Public Sector Undertakings, Public Sector Banks and other Central Government
organizations. The scope of its examination includes execution of works,
purchase of goods, hiring of services, etc. which are mainly funded by the Central
Government.
5.4 The CTEO is headed by two Chief Technical Examiners (CTEs). One of them is
responsible for examination of civil/horticulture related procurement cases and
matters and the other one for all other types of procurement contracts viz.,
supply contracts, electrical/mechanical contracts, IT procurements, consultancy
and service contracts, transport contracts etc. and related matters. The CTEs are

assisted by a team of Technical Examiners (TEs), Assistant Technical Examiners
(ATEs) and Junior Technical Examiners (JTEs).
5.5 The main functions of CTEO include technical and financial scrutiny of various
procurement cases of the different organisations, to provide its opinion to
the Commission on policy matters related to public procurement and matters
referred to the Commission for its advice by the Ministries, Departments of the
Government of India and other organisations covered under the jurisdiction
of the Commission. As part of preventive vigilance and system improvement,
CTEs/TEs participate in workshops and seminars on issues related to public
procurement.
INTENSIVE EXAMINATION OF PROCUREMENT CASES
5.6 The selection of cases for intensive examination is primarily based on the
Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs) submitted by the Chief Vigilance Officers
(CVOs) of respective organisations and complaints received from various
sources. Intensive examination is also done on the basis of the criticality, nature
and the time and cost overrun involved in the procurement cases reported. The
CVOs are required to furnish every quarter, details pertaining to different type
of procurement cases, completed or on-going, with a contract value above the
prescribed threshold values. As per extant instructions, the threshold values
are Rs. 5.0 crore and above for civil and turnkey works, supply contracts, Public
Private Partnerships, sale of scrap and land etc., Rs. 1.0 crore and above for
electrical, mechanical works, maintenance and service contracts, manpower
supply and consultancy contracts, Rs. 50 lakh and above for medical equipment,
Rs. 10 lakh and above for horticulture works and four largest value contracts
for supply of medicines. During 2024, 371 organisations submitted their QPRs.
At times, intensive examination is also undertaken based on complaint alleging
specific misconduct/irregularities.
5.7 During the year 2024, CTEO undertook intensive examinations of 81 procurement
cases, covering 64 Organisations. The value of these procurement cases was

Financial Rules, policies of Government of India, prescribed guidelines as well as
from the procurement manual of the organisations are brought to the notice of
the concerned procurement agency. In addition, issues related to transparency,
efficiency, fair and equal treatment of bidders, over-payments, deficiencies in
quality, time and cost overruns, tax avoidance, non-compliance of statutory and
82 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
other norms, etc. are included in the report. Some of the important irregularities
observed during the intensive examinations carried out during 2024 are at
Appendix IV.
5.10 Intensive examination reports, after approval of CTE, are forwarded to the
CVO of the organization for obtaining comments/action taken report from
Management/officials concerned in respect of the observations raised in the
report. Cases of irregularities, with perceived vigilance angle, are referred to the
CVOs for detailed vigilance investigation and for fixing of responsibility. Ten (10)
such cases were referred to the CVOs during the year. The action taken on the
observations in the intensive examination report resulted in a large number of
systemic improvements, besides punitive action against erring officials. Recovery
of Rs. 116.75 crore was also effected by the Organisations concerned from the
contractors/suppliers/service providers based on the observations in intensive
examination report. Some of the cases, which were referred to CVOs for detailed
vigilance investigations during 2024, are listed at Appendix V.
5.11 As a result of observations made by CTEO during the course of the intensive
examinations, a number of systemic improvements were initiated by respective
organisations. These systemic improvements were on the issues like timely
signing of contract, updating status of tender on e-procurement portal, test
check with proper details of test check amount, issue of completion certificate
after proper verification of actual work, etc. Some of the significant systemic
improvements are listed at Appendix VI.
CTE TYPE INTENSIVE EXAMINATION BY CVOs
5.12 The Commission decided that intensive examinations, similar to those being
carried out by CTEO, be also carried out by the CVOs, in their respective
organisations. CVOs carry out intensive examination of some selected
procurement contracts, broadly representing spectrum of the core activities of
the organisation and report the outcome to the Commission. As reported by the
CVOs of 299 organisations, 1845 CTE type examination of procurement activities
were conducted during the year 2024, leading to recovery of Rs. 917.93 lakh,
299 vigilance cases and 2892 systemic improvements.

complaint cases referred to it.
IMPORTANT INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE CTEO
5.14 Under the guidance of the Commission, CTEO during the year 2024, in
continuation of the efforts towards emphasis on preventive vigilance, provided
technical inputs to various organisations towards capacity building and sensitizing
officials about various aspects of vigilance; especially, areas pertaining to
tenders and contracting, estimation of rates, legal aspects in contracting, CTE
type intensive examination etc. were covered in training programs and seminars
organised by various organisations during the year.
5.15 As a measure of capacity building in the area of CTE type intensive examination,
a two-days special training programme for CVOs and vigilance officers was
conducted. CVOs and vigilance officers of around 55 organisations attended the
training programme. Apart from the focus on the areas and issues, which should

CHAPTER 6
SUPERINTENDENCE OVER CENTRAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION
INTRODUCTION
6.1 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is the premier investigating police
agency of the country. It is also the country’s nodal agency to coordinate
investigation on behalf of Interpol Member countries.
6.2 A Central Government Police Force, by the name of Special Police Establishment
(SPE) was set up by an executive order of the Government of India in 1941, in
the early stages of World War−II, with the purpose of conducting investigation
in cases of bribery and corruption in transactions with which War and Supply
Department of the Government of India was concerned. After the war, a
need was felt to have a permanent Central Government Agency, which could
be mandated to investigate corruption related matters in respect of Central
Government employees. To address this issue, Delhi Special Police Establishment
Act, 1946 was passed, through which the scope of SPE was extended to cover
all departments of Government of India. Later on, its jurisdiction was extended
over all Union Territories and also States, with their prior consent.
6.3 The Government of India had set up a Committee on ‘Prevention of Corruption’,
which is popularly known as Santhanam Committee. The Committee in its
recommendations dated 17.11.1962, advised the Government to give additional
responsibilities to SPE. As a consequence of that, the Government of India notified
a Resolution dated 01.04.1963, giving the agency a new name, Central Bureau
of Investigation and expanding its scope. Initially, CBI’s role covered corruption
related issues by Central Government employees. Later on, employees of Central
Public Sector Enterprises, Public Sector Banks and other organisations were also
brought within ambit of CBI.
6.4 CBI’s reputation as a competent investigating agency has led to increased
demand to take up investigation of cases of diversified nature. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India and Hon’ble High Courts have also started entrusting
86 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
cases to CBI for investigation. With the increase in scope of work, in 1987, it was
decided to constitute two investigation divisions in CBI i.e. (i) Anti−Corruption
Division; and (ii) Special Crimes Division. The Special Crimes Division was given
the responsibility of dealing with cases of conventional crime and economic
offences. A separate Banking Fraud and Securities Cell was also created in the
wake of securities scam of 1992. In 1994, CBI’s work was further reorganised into
three divisions, namely Anti−Corruption, Economic Crimes and Special Crimes.
SUPERINTENDENCE OF CVC OVER CBI
6.5 The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its order dated 18.12.1997 in Criminal Writ Petition
Nos 340−343/93 in the matter of Vineet Narain and others v/s Union of India case
envisioned greater autonomy and objectivity for CBI. In pursuance of the orders
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) Act,
2003 was enacted which statutorily mandated CVC to exercise superintendence
over the functioning of CBI in respect of investigations of offences under the
provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act,1988, by the agency.
6.6 Section 8(1) of the CVC Act, 2003, defines that the functions and powers of CVC
in respect of CBI shall be to:
(a) exercise superintendence over the functioning of the Delhi Special Police
Establishment in so far as it relates to the investigation of offences alleged
to have been committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 or
an offence with which a public servant specified in sub−section (2) may,
under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Now Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita - 2023), be charged at the same trial;[Section 8(1)(a) of
CVC Act, 2003].
(b) give directions to the Delhi Special Police Establishment for the purpose
of discharging the responsibility entrusted to it under sub−section (1) of
section 4 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946:
Provided that while exercising the powers of superintendence under clause (a)
or giving directions under this clause, the Commission shall not exercise powers
in such a manner so as to require the Delhi Special Police Establishment to
investigate or dispose of any case in a particular manner; [Section 8(1)(b) of CVC
Act, 2003].
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 87
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
(c) review the progress of investigations conducted by the Delhi Special
Police Establishment into offences alleged to have been committed under
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 or the public servant may, under
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Now Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha
Sanhita - 2023), be charged at the same trial. [Section 8(1)(e) of CVC Act,
2003].
6.7 Similarly, Section 4 of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 was also
amended w.e.f. 01.09.2003. The amended section 4 reads as follows:
“4. Superintendence and administration of Special Police Establishment.
(1) The superintendence of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in so far
as it relates to investigation of offences alleged to have been committed
under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (49 of 1988), shall vest in
the Commission.
(2) Save as otherwise provided in sub−section (1), the superintendence of
the said police establishment in all other matters shall vest in the Central
Government.”
6.8 In order to comply with the statutory requirement of exercising superintendence
over the functioning of CBI, the Commission undertakes the following functions:
i) Monthly review meetings with the Director, CBI to discuss progress
of cases under investigation/inquiry, reasons for delay, if any, status of
pending prosecution sanctions, etc.;

necessary;
iii) To issue directions for investigation and report in exercise of powers under
Section 8(1) (d) of CVC Act, 2003;
iv) To examine the reports of investigation received from CBI about
misconducts committed by officers covered under the jurisdiction of the
Commission and to advise the Competent Authorities for initiation of
disciplinary proceedings and/or grant of sanction for prosecution;
v) To review progress of sanction for prosecution pending with the
competent authorities and to get decisions expedited;
88 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
vi) To call for reports/returns, as may be required;
vii) To recommend officers for appointment to posts of the level of SP and

6.14 It is expected of CBI to complete investigation within one year of registration of
case. Completion of investigation would imply filing of charge sheet in a court of
law wherever warranted, after receipt of sanction from the competent authority,
if required. Some delay has been observed in completion of investigation in
certain cases. The reasons for delay in completion of investigation includes:
a) delay due to excessive work,
b) inadequate manpower,
c) delay in obtaining responses to Letters Rogatory (LRs),
d) time consumed in verification of documents/title deeds, etc., in
disproportionate asset cases,
e) delay in providing forensic reports by the forensic laboratories and reports
by other experts,
f) delay in granting prosecution sanction by the competent authorities, etc.,
g) delay in providing of relevant records/documents by the authorities
concerned,
h) time consuming efforts required for scrutiny of voluminous records,
especially in economic offences and bank fraud cases, and

PREVIOUS SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION AGAINST CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
6.16 Section 19 (1) of Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 (as amended in 2018)
provides that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under
Sections 7,11,13 and 15 of PC Act, alleged to have been committed by a public
servant, who is employed or as the case may be, was at the time of commission of
the alleged offence, employed in connection with the affairs of the Union/State,
except with the previous sanction of Central Govt./State Govt./the authority
competent to remove him from his office.
6.17 The amended provision also stipulates that no request can be made, by a person
other than a police officer or an officer of an investigation agency or other law
enforcement authority, to the appropriate Government or competent authority,
as the case may be, for the previous sanction of such Government or authority for
taking cognizance by the court of any of the offences specified, unless − (i) such
person has filed a complaint in a competent court about the alleged offences for
which the public servant is sought to be prosecuted; and (ii) the court has not
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 93
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
dismissed the complaint under Section 203 of the CrPC (Now Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita - 2023, Section 226) and directed the complainant to obtain
the sanction for prosecution against the public servant for further proceedings.
6.18 Further, it has also been specified that in case of request from the person
other than a police officer or an officer of an investigation agency or other law
enforcement authority, the appropriate Government or competent authority
shall not accord sanction to prosecute a public servant without providing an
opportunity of being heard to the concerned public servant.
6.19 On receipt of a request for grant of previous sanction for prosecution under
Section 19(1) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 from CBI or other investigating
agency and while processing such requests, all the Ministries/Departments/
Organisations need to take decisions expeditiously and in accordance with
the guidelines issued by the Commission vide its circular Nos. 31/05/05 dated
12.05.2005, 07/03/12 dated 28.03.2012 and 08/05/15 dated 25.05.2015. The
amended PC Act, 1988 also provides that the appropriate Government or any
competent authority shall, after the receipt of the proposal requiring sanction
for prosecution of a public servant endeavour to convey the decision on such
proposal within a period of 3 months from the date of its receipt.
6.20 In case where, for the purpose of grant of sanction of prosecution, consultation is
required with the Attorney General or any Law Officer in the Attorney General’s
office, the period may be extended by further one month, for reasons to be
recorded in writing. The Commission, in terms of its mandate under Section 8(1)
(f) of the CVC Act, 2003, has issued directions that all administrative authorities
should methodically follow the guidelines while considering and deciding
requests for sanction for prosecution from the investigating agency.
6.21 The Commission reviews the progress of cases pending with respective authorities
for sanction for prosecution under PC Act, 1988. CBI reported that at the end
of the year 2024, a total of 200 cases were pending for grant of prosecution
sanction under PC Act, 1988, which belong to 46 different organisations. In
these cases pending with various organisations, 534 requests have been made
for granting prosecution sanction, as some of the cases involved more than one
accused person.

CHAPTER 7
PREVENTIVE VIGILANCE AND
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS
BACKGROUND
7.1 The main aim of preventive vigilance is to establish a system of governance,
by which the scope of indulging in inappropriate activities is eliminated or
reduced to the minimum extent possible. Effective Preventive Vigilance
measures include identification and plugging vulnerable areas through systemic
improvements and structural remedies. These measures fulfill the dual objective
of pre−empting corrupt practices and misconducts as well as further enhancing
organizational efficiency. Standardization, automation, leveraging technology,
reducing discretion and human interface, simplification of rules and procedures,
transparency, accountability, training and awareness are important tools of
preventive vigilance.
7.2 The report of Santhanam Committee recognized the importance of preventive
vigilance in reducing or eliminating corruption. The Committee observed that
unless planned preventive measures are implemented in a sustained and
effective manner, corruption cannot be eliminated or even reduced significantly.
The main effort for checking corruption must come from within the organisation
and it is vital to have a continuous watch on sensitive areas rather than merely
acting after occurrence of an irregularity.
7.3 The Commission has identified the following broad areas, which need special
attention while implementing preventive vigilance measures:−
 Allocation of resources like rights, lease, licenses, loans etc.
 Public procurement and management of contracts,
 Auction/sale of Goods, Public Assets etc.
 Recruitment, promotion, transfer and posting,
102 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
 Delivery of public services,
 Social welfare schemes,
 Determination of tax liabilities,
 Misappropriation of public assets.
COMMISSION’S INITIATIVES IN AREA OF PREVENTIVE VIGILANCE
7.4 As a precursor to Vigilance Awareness Week 2024, the Commission had
launched a three−month campaign in five areas focusing on preventive vigilance
and capacity building measures to be taken by all the Ministries/Departments/
Organizations. These five focus areas were as follows:−
 Capacity Building Programs;
 Identification and Implementation of Systemic Improvement Measures;
 Updation of Circulars/Guidelines/Manuals;
 Disposal of Complaints; and
 Dynamic Digital Presence.
7.5 These initiatives have developed an awareness among the organizations in
the field of preventive vigilance. A large number of organizations had actively
participated and took significant action in these preventive vigilance focus areas.
7.6 There is a scope of implementing preventive vigilance measures in almost all
operational areas of an organization. Preventive vigilance measures can broadly
be categorized as the following:−
Simplification and Standardization of Rules
Simplification and standardization of rules and procedures facilitates elimination
of discretion and arbitrariness and helps to reduce corruption. Identifying
areas involving exercise of discretion which are not properly regulated by clear
guidelines, as well as a complete review of existing rules and regulations needs
to be undertaken to promote clarity and accountability. Similarly, simplification
and standardization of forms/applications also reduces scope for corruption.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 103
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Leveraging Technology and Automation
Experience suggests that technology plays an enabling and effective role in fighting
corruption. E−procurements, E−payments, use of websites for dissemination of
information and creating awareness, use of CCTV in places of public dealing,
use of Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled devices/Radio Frequency
Identification (RFIDs), computer assisted audit techniques for detecting frauds
are some of the examples as to how technology provides considerable strength
to the system of preventive vigilance. Automation reduces interface/interaction
between public officials and the common public. It also removes a monopoly on
delivery of services and reduces personal discretion of the concerned officials.
Business Process Re-engineering (BPR)
BPR is very important as it helps the organisations rethink how they fulfil their
core objectives, and in the process, encourages a full−scale re−creation of
processes for fulfilling the objectives of the organisation. Existing processes may
be re−engineered to prevent revenue leakage as well.
Transparency
Transparency removes asymmetry of information between the public and public
officials and thus in turn reduces corruption. For example, the website of every
Department/Organisation should contain its rules and regulations, process
details and procedures, contact details of concerned officials and all other
information useful for common public/customers.
Accountability
It is very difficult to take punitive action due to lack of accountability. A system
with clear accountability and assigned responsibility at each level is necessary not
only for smooth functioning but also for ensuring timely and effective punitive
action in case of misconduct.
 Control and Supervision
Regular and routine inspections, surprise inspections, audit and reviews keep a
check on aberrant and corrupt behaviour.
104 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Early Detection of Misconducts
Early detection of misconduct, apart from bringing to light the deficiencies of
the system, will also enable recouping of losses wherever possible and facilitate
prevention of further damage and financial loss.
Time-Bound and Effective Punitive Action
Punitive action within a short period of occurrence of the misconduct and
finalization of such cases in a time−bound manner resulting in award of exemplary
and adequate punishment, deters others from committing such misconduct in
future. At the same time, any prolonged delay in awarding punishment to wrong
doers sends negative signal to other people in the organisation who are working
as per norms and following systems and procedures.
Training and Awareness
Capacity building and sensitization at all levels and across all functional
areas is important. Public officials should be made aware of their duties and
responsibilities, code of conduct, rules and regulations, etc., through regular
training and awareness programs. Knowledge sharing initiatives such as
publishing/circulating information relating to areas where fraud/misconduct
has been detected and sharing information on best practices are other effective
awareness generation methods for better preventive vigilance.
Conducive Work Environment
Conducive work environment may include drawing up lists of sensitive posts,
implementing a rotational transfer policy for sensitive posts, identification of
persons of doubtful integrity and keeping them away from sensitive posts/ public
dealing. It would be necessary also to create an environment that promotes
ethical behaviour. Protection to Whistle Blowers must be ensured in order to bring
to light cases of corruption. Non−provision of adequate infrastructural facilities
such as accommodation, conveyance, utilities, etc. also induces corruption.
Awareness Among Public
If public is made aware of their rights and also of rules and regulations, then they
may be able to resist unfair treatment and arbitrary exercise of power by public
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 105
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
officials. Public organizations should prominently display information relevant/
useful to the common public on their office notice board/website.
Inculcating Ethical Behaviour
Inculcating ethical behavior among employees and public, particularly the
younger generation is an important tool of preventive vigilance. Vigilance
Awareness Week (VAW), observed every year intends to create such public
awareness. This opportunity is utilized by all CVOs/Organisations to create
awareness among public as well as among their own officials regarding the need
to uphold correct values.
Whistle Blower Mechanism
The Commission encourages all organisations to establish Whistle Blower
mechanisms as a method of identifying corrupt practices and as a means to
achieve improvement of systems within an organisation.
7.7 The Central Vigilance Commission has been emphasizing preventive vigilance
measures to tackle areas susceptible to corruption, which has led to various
successful initiatives undertaken by Govt. organizations including Ministries/
Departments, Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), Public Sector Banks
(PSBs) and other Financial Institutions (FIs) to enhance good governance. The
Commission has proactively taken forward the agenda of preventive vigilance.
Some of the significant initiatives taken in this direction include the following
measures:−
Conferences on Leveraging Technology for Good Governance and
Transparency
In an era where digital transformation is reshaping various sectors, the
importance of leveraging technology to enhance service delivery, ensuring
transparency, and preventing fraud has never been more critical. The rapid
growth of digital technologies has transformed the banking, financial services
and Insurance sectors. While digitization has brought unparalleled convenience
and efficiency, it has also exposed these sectors to new vulnerabilities and
threats of frauds and cybercrimes.
106 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
With a view to synergize the efforts of all the stakeholders in preventing frauds/
cyber frauds in financial sectors and leveraging the technology for increasing
transparency in governance, two conferences were organized by the Central
Vigilance Commission in the month of August, 2024.
The conference organized by the Commission focused on the topics of
“Leveraging Technology for Increasing Transparency in Governance”. This
conference aimed to share and present best practices on leveraging technology
for vigilance administration and project monitoring. The sessions covered various
digital initiatives such as the Vigilance Clearance System, Vigilance Complaint
Management Portal, Disciplinary Workflow Process, Online Monitoring of Public
Projects, and Internal Grievance Redressal Portal.
Another conference on the topic “Digital Initiatives to Prevent Banking, Financial
Services and Insurance frauds,” organized by the Commission, highlighted the
pressing need for financial institutions to adopt advanced technologies to
combat the increasingly sophisticated tactics of cybercriminals. Industry leaders
discussed the implementation of multi-layered strategies involving technology,
data, artificial intelligence, and human expertise to create robust defenses against
fraud. The conference underscored the importance of collaboration among
financial institutions and the need to educate both customers and employees
about common fraud tactics and best practices.
Both conferences emphasized the critical role of technology in creating a secure
and transparent environment. While the financial sector focuses on preventing
frauds through advanced technological interventions, the governance sector
aims to enhance transparency and efficiency. The shared goal is to build resilient
systems that can adapt to the evolving digital landscape.
Training and Awareness
The Commission believes that preventive vigilance is a continuous process and
there should be a culture and environment developed in organisations to nurture
it. Accordingly, the Commission has advised the centralized training institutes
as well as the PSUs and Public Sector Banks/ Financial Institutions to include
modules on preventive vigilance in their induction training programs for young
officers and in−service and mid−career training courses.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 107
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Dissemination of Good Practices
For dissemination of good practices adopted by organisations in the area of
preventive vigilance, the Commission has published a booklet on preventive
vigilance initiatives taken by different organizations during the year 2024.
Inculcating Ethical Behaviour Among Employees and the Public
The Commission’s Vigilance Awareness Week (VAW) activities are a significant
step for awareness generation among all stake holders, particularly the students
and youth through outreach activities. The Commission has propagated that all
organizations must send their officers and staff during the induction and mid−
career training for exposure to the good practices adopted in organizations.
Training, Capacity Building and Skill Upgradation
The Commission has been training the CVOs/ Dy. CVOs as well as management
of the departments/ organisations through customized programs conducted at
reputed training institutions. The Commission has also organized nationwide
training programs for Inquiry Officers and Presenting Officers to build their
capacity to handle departmental inquiries in a timely and professional manner.
Review of Preventive Vigilance Initiatives by Organisations
During the Review meetings/Annual Sectoral Review meetings with the Ministries/
Departments/Organisations in 2024, the Commission has been reviewing
initiatives taken by various organisations for effective preventive vigilance. This
is also reviewed through the CVO’s Quarterly Performance Reports.
Scrutiny of Audit Reports by Chief Vigilance Officers (CVOs)
The Commission has been reiterating that the audit reports (internal audit,
statutory audit and C&AG audit) should be thoroughly examined by the CVOs to
identify audit observations that have a vigilance angle so that timely action may
be taken to prevent any misdeed. The Commission has insisted on submission
of detailed reports from CVOs in this area. The point has been included in the
CVOs’ Quarterly Performance Reports furnished during each quarter. During the
Annual Sectoral Review meetings, the Commission reviews the status of scrutiny
of audit reports with the CVOs.
108 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Continuous Revision of Manuals
The Commission has been advising the CVOs to ensure that the organisations
have prepared Manuals on important areas of their functioning such as contracts,
procurements, recruitment etc. and that these are updated and conform to
guidelines of CVC as well as their respective Ministries. Additionally, the CVOs
have been advised to identify which Manuals are needed and which are available
in the organisation. The Commission has desired that these Manuals may be
available on the concerned organisation’s website.
Continuous Revision of Processes
The Commission has been advising the CVOs to carry out regular review of
various processes and systems with a view to dovetail the systems with the
latest available technology, and to generate exception reports on the use of
discretionary powers with the help of these systems.
Asset Registers
Given that the public sector organisations/departments control a large inventory
of assets, there is a need for better asset management. The Commission has
advised organisations to prepare Asset Registers in digital form after taking stock
of all their assets.
Systemic Improvements
Systemic Improvement in an organisation as part of preventive vigilance strategy,
causes a change, which not only alters a fundamental system/process being
followed till now, but also improves the efficaciousness of the whole organization.
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMISSION
7.8 The Commission has suggested several systemic improvements in the year 2024,
some of them are mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs.
Ministry of Railways
7.9 It was observed by the Commission that there are irregularities in roster
maintenance by station staff and claiming of inflated Over Time Allowance
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 109
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
(OTA) by swapping duties. Accordingly, installation of biometric attendance or
face recognition and linking it to processing and admission of OTA claims was
advised by the Commission to enhance accountability and transparency in the
system. It was also advised to prevent informal duty swapping and deviation
from assigned roster to be reported through official channels and notify railway
establishments about lapses identified in this case.
On advice of the Commission, Railways have informed that all zonal railways
have been instructed for installation of biometric attendance machines for all
station staff including Station Master, Station Supervisor, Points men, etc and
link digital attendance records to OTA claims for accountability. Maintenance
of duty rosters and reporting of any deviations from assigned rosters through
official channels have been made mandatory to avoid duty swapping at local
level.
7.10 In another case, the Commission observed that in South Eastern Railway (SER),
scrap and sold locomotives were repaired without recovering the expenditure
involved from the buyer. Also, the ground rent was not recovered from the
buyer for the period beyond the stipulated time limit allowed to remove the
said locos from the Railway shed. This resulted in monetary loss to the Railways’
exchequer.
The Commission further observed that this could happen due to the absence of
clarity about responsibility and coordination amongst various divisions of the
Railways along with vague terms and conditions of Sale Release Order (SRO). As
a systemic improvement, it was advised that every stage along with the relevant
stakeholder in the release process of sold locomotives to be clearly identified and
preferable timelines may also be prescribed to ensure clarity of responsibilities.
Also, a clear clause about ground rent charge should be included in the SRO and
it should be duly communicated to various stakeholders clearly delineating their
role and responsibilities.
The improvements suggested have been implemented by SER with detailed
procedure for handing over the locomotives sold clearly indicating the role and
responsibilities of stakeholders and the timelines for each stage involved in the
process.
110 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
7.11 In one case, irregularities in cash handling and non-submission of accounts of
advances within a reasonable time frame in Railways was observed. Accordingly,
it was advised to review the guidelines for imprest and cash handling to establish
a clear timeline for recovery of unutilized cash.
In view of the above, the following actions have been taken to ensure better
handling of cash, accountability and to deter misuse and negligence: -
(i) Regular Review: Imprest and cash advances should be subjected to
intensive review at regular intervals to ensure timely utilization and
reconciliation of funds.
(ii) Introduction of a penalty clause:- Introduction of a penalty clause will
be considered for imposing a penal interest on unutilized imprest/cash
advance that remains unspent beyond stipulated period. (e.g. 60 or 90
Days).
(iii) Salary adjustment mechanism: A system of recovery of unutilized cash
from salary of the officers concerned will be evolved after a predefined
period with prior notice and necessary approvals.
(iv) Awareness Campaign: An awareness campaign to be launched on proper
imprest and cash handling to avoid lapses.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL)
7.12 BPCL’s fleet of tank lorries distributing petroleum products faced persistent
pilferage despite measures like plastic seals, Abloy locks, and Electro-Mechanical
(EM) locks. The manual monitoring of the Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) remained
challenging due to vast data volumes.
The Commission highlighted the significant collective loss from pilferage and
urged Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to take stringent action, including
recovery from transporters.
In response, BPCL integrated VTS with its centralized monitoring system, IRIS,
enabling automatic deviation tracking, enhancing transparency, and reducing
pilferage.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 111
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
The VTS was reconfigured with new functionalities, including:
• No-halt zones and suspicious pilferage points,
• Route deviation, speed violation, unauthorized stoppage,
• Power disconnects, harsh braking/acceleration, and night driving
monitoring. The EM lock OTP process was updated, and VTS data is
now pushed to IRIS in real time. Violations trigger automatic tank lorry
blocking in the SAP system, with unblocking subject to field verification
and approval through a maker-checker process.
After implementation of the above measures, pilferage incidents reduced
by 67.7% in March 2024 compared to April 2023. In addition, BPCL plans to
implement AI tools for automated analysis of system alerts to further enhance
monitoring and identify risk areas.
7.13 In a case of delay in the reconstitution of an LPG distributorship and an allegation
of illegal approval for reconstitution, it was observed that despite a registered
“will” transferring ownership to the grandson, the approved reconstitution
excluded him and included estranged daughters which led to a legal dispute.
Further, BPCL resumed LPG supply to the distributorship, disregarding the
pending litigation.
As a systemic improvement measure, the Commission advised time-bound
disposal of reconstitution proposals and issuance of guidelines to clarify the
conditions when proposals for reconstitution can be kept on hold in sub-judice
cases. The Commission also advised distributor education on wills, partnership
clauses, and nomination options in the system in death cases to prevent disputes.
BPCL informed that the LPG Business Unit initiated a 'Know Your Customer'
campaign to update data on partnership and to address the issue of "Benami"
operations in LPG distributorship. Reconstitution proposals are processed within
specified timelines, with scrutiny of partnership deeds in terms of selection/
reconstitution guidelines. Distributors have been educated on the importance
of the nomination option, and ‘wills’ are not accepted for reconstitution.
112 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL)
7.14 In a case, it was observed that concerned authorities are not getting timely
information about the land and assets encroachment in SAIL Growth Works
(SGW), Kulti of IISCO Steel Plant. In the existing system, the renewable dates of
the licensed assets are checked manually which result in chances of missing the
date and unauthorized occupancy. There was a lack of structured mechanism for
taking up the encroachment cases.
The urgent requirement of systemic approach for surveying and documentation
of lands and assets to ensure accurate record of boundaries and land use
was observed. Accordingly, the following systemic improvements have been
implemented:
(i) The contract has been issued for Land Record and Information Management
System (LRIMS) for mapping of Land & Quarters and their continuous
Monitoring.
(ii) Software for automated alert of upcoming renewal of license to prevent
unauthorized occupancy and illegal continuation of occupancy of the staff
quarters is being developed with the support of IT team.
SJVN Limited (SJVN)
7.15 During the intensive examination of Parasan Solar Power Project, it was observed
that SJVN has not defined Guaranteed Technical Parameters (GTP) (max. losses)
for major electrical equipment such as Power transformers, Auxiliary transformer,
Inverter transformer, Inverters in detailed technical specification of Notice for
Inviting Tenders (NITs).
Given that projects are generally envisioned to operate for a substantial duration,
it is imperative to address potential financial implication stemming from losses
incurred by the equipment.
While the provisions for Performance Guarantee (PG) testing and Liquidated
Damages (LD) outlined in the contracts, can be said to be instruments/provisions
to deal with deviations, explicitly defining GTPs for all major electrical equipment
will not only ensure the requisite energy production throughout the project's
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 113
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
lifecycle but also provide greater clarity and accountability in procurement
processes.
Accordingly, SJVN has implemented a policy to include clear and comprehensive
specifications regarding GTPs for all major electrical equipment alongside other
relevant output parameters in the Technical Specification of the NITs.
This will ensure that the equipment meets the required specification &
performance/output, improving the overall performance and reliability of the
solar project. This will also ensure the quality of equipment as intended in the
procurement process.
Damodar Valley Corporation
7.16 The Commission observed irregularities in timely generation and recovery of
electricity bill from the consumers and irregularities in disconnection notices in
Damodar Valley Corporation.
On the advice of the Commission as systemic improvement measures, Remote
Automatic Meter Readings system (RAMR) has been introduced through which
consumer meter reading (for 33 kV and above) is taken automatically. This
resulted in quick collection of Meter reading of all the consumers and thereby
early preparation of Consumer electricity bill. The consumer payment data is
being directly fetched from Bank server after payment integration from July 2024.
The Billing Module has the real time payment data and as such Disconnection
Notice issuance through Billing Module has also been implemented.
Bank of India
7.17 Based on the workshop conducted by the Commission on “Best Practices on
Leveraging Technology for increasing transparency in Governance”, below
mentioned systemic improvements have been undertaken:
With a view to leveraging technology for more transparency in processing
Vigilance complaints, the complaints received via email, or the website are
seamlessly integrated with the upgraded web-based Customer Relationship
Management (CRM Next) module. Through this system, complaints are assigned
to an officer in the Vigilance Department (Maker) and tracked throughout the
114 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
workflow until closure. Once the Maker has processed the complaint, the same
is forwarded to the Checker (who is the supervisory officer) to validate and
review the complaint.
7.18 Bank of India has developed a Preventive Vigilance Inspection module, which
empowers Vigilance Officers at the zonal level to conduct surprise inspections
of branches through the portal. Any irregularities observed during inspections
are managed within the portal, with compliance responsibilities assigned to
all relevant stakeholders, including Branch officers, Zone officers and Vigilance
Department.
Department of Fertilizers
7.19 In a case of “Import of Urea on Govt. Account, MMTC” it was observed by the
Commission that an NIT was published in newspaper with last date of submission
and bid opening date which was less than 7 days from the date of publication.
Also, an addendum was issued without extending the last date of bid submission
and opening date.
Accordingly, for wider publicity of the NIT and more transparency in the bidding
process, on the advice of Commission, Department of Fertilizer has revised the
time frame for the tendering process.
Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL)
7.20 During the Intensive Examination of "Turnkey Supply, Installation, Commissioning
of Ship lift and Transfer System", the following issues were observed:
(i) Relevant guidelines issued by the Government of India were not considered
for the publication of tenders in the case of Global Tenders.
(ii) There was no clear guideline available in CSL regarding fixing conversion
rate date in respect of Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) in case of Global
Tender.
(iii) There was no guideline for imposing penalty on late submission of
Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG).
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 115
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
On recommendation of the Commission for systemic improvement, the following steps
have been taken by CSL:
A. Sending copies of the tender notice to the Indian embassies abroad and the
foreign embassies in India.
B. CSL shall fix the currency conversion rate with respect to EMD in Global Tender
during the tendering stage, and the conversion rate shall be indicated in tender
documents. A policy for approval from the competent authority for fixing
conversion rate in reputed currencies (Euro, USD, Pounds, Yen) during tender
stage has been implemented.
C. As per the CSL Material Manual, the security deposit (SD) shall be furnished within
a specific date (generally 14 days) after notification of the award of contract.
Delay in non-payment of SD/PBG is considered as one of the major default and
in such cases, CSL can terminate the order, upon default by the contractor, if no
remedial action is taken in 30 days or such longer time as agreed upon by the
parties after receipt of notice thereof, in writing from the non-defaulting party,
including encashment of EMD.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Authority
7.21 It was observed that the Circulars, Guidelines, Manuals, SOPs, Policy etc. issued
in physical paper form did not reach widely amongst every employee of the
Organization and no common platform was available, where these Guidelines,
Manuals, SOPs, Policy etc. can be made available in digital format.
The Commission, during Vigilance Awareness Week 2024 campaign on Preventive
Vigilance with focus on Dynamic Digital Presence, suggested to create a Circular
Management Portal and upload all the Circulars, guidelines, manuals, policy,
rules & regulations and other information etc. to increase transparency and to
ensure easy and wide reach and access to all the employees of the port.
Circular Management Portal as Intranet Website Portal has been created. All
the Departments and Divisions of Kolkata Dock System (KDS) were advised to
upload the Circulars and to ensure wide publicity of this portal.
116 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Central Board of Direct Taxes
7.22 In various cases of refund frauds referred to the Commission, CBDT has been
advised to lay down future road map and further checks to avoid recurrence of
such frauds:
(i) Strengthen refund system with additional checks.
(ii) To authenticate the login using advance technology of SMS/e-mail alert to
higher authority about any alteration/ misappropriation in data entered
into system for high value refunds.
CBDT has informed that various initiatives are taken by the Department:
New ITBA 2.0 project (successor of the current ITBA 1.0) will enable the users to
authenticate the login using advance technology of soft mobile token (OTP) inline with NIC’s Kavach system in place of present regime of RSA Token which was
earlier adopted based on technology available then in line with advice tendered
by CVC regarding ‘SMS alert’.
A data interface is proposed to be built between CPC-ITR and CPC-TDS to share
the TDS consumption data. Once TDS has been consumed by deductee, CPCTDS will freeze corresponding TDS rows. Therefore, deductors will not be able to
modify such deductee rows to provide same TDS credit to multiple deductees.
In many refund fraud cases, the deductors file TDS/TCS statements without
making payment of the corresponding amount of deducted tax in the
Government account. Based on the statements filed by deductors (TAN holders),
TDS/TCS credit is passed on to the deductees (PAN holders), who in turn claim
TDS/TCS credit through their ITRs which may result in refunds. In such default
cases of unpaid TDS/TCS, it is proposed that such TDS/TCS statements may be
rejected after ‘in-warding’ i.e. are not processed, at the CPC. This will address
the problem of such frauds/fraudulent refunds as such deductees would not be
allowed credit of such unpaid TDS/TCS while processing of their ITRs.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 117
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED BY THE ORGANIZATIONS
7.23 Organisations have implemented various systemic improvements in the year
2024. Some of the systemic improvements are mentioned below:
Ministry of Railways
7.24 Difficulties were observed in monitoring and collection of stabling charge for
private owned rake stabled at Railway premises. Accordingly, following systemic
improvements have been implemented:
i) To include a reason 'attributed to Party' in dropdown menu for collection
of stabling charges.
ii) To include the reason 'because of detention of General Purpose Wagon
Investment Scheme (GPWIS) rake beyond free time in private siding.
UCO Bank
7.25 On many occasions such as obtaining NOC for Passport, Private Foreign visits,
Staff Loans and Advances, retirement, resignations, outside employment/
deputation and for Sabbatical/Study Leave etc, vigilance clearance in respect
of the employee concerned is required to be obtained from the respective
authorities of the bank.
As a systemic improvement measure, Vigilance Clearance Module in HRMS of
UCO Bank has been initiated for processing Vigilance Clearance cases in respect
of employees of the bank.
This module is beneficial in the following manner:
a. It ensures security and data integrity with advance reporting and analytics
capabilities for data driven decision making, identifying trends and areas
of improvement.
b. Minimize the processing time and enhance transparency in processing of
vigilance clearance cases.
The Vigilance Profile generated contains information of all points/parameters
as per the guidelines for grant/withholding of vigilance clearance & contains
118 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
updated additional information from Vigilance Record Management System and
Regular Disciplinary Action (RDA) Module in real-time.
Union Bank of India
7.26 To avoid delay in completion of disciplinary proceedings and making it more
efficient and transparent, an online portal for paperless disciplinary procedure
from initiation to issuance of speaking orders, has been launched by Union Bank
of India as “Project Vishwas”. Its first Phase has been launched on 28.10.2024.
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
7.27 Keeping in view the importance of IT applications in making the operations of the
organizations more efficient and transparent, NABARD has established its own
NABARD Software Factory (NSF) to have an internal mechanism for development
of software and IT applications with low and medium complexity.
This is enabling the organization to quickly transform an idea into software
applications. NSF has developed a complete application development pipeline.
Since its establishment in November 2024, three applications have been
developed with the Low Code Application Platform (LCAP) to meet the business
and regulatory requirements of the organization.
Bank of India
7.28 It was observed that, procurement in Bank of India was being carried out by
various departments in Head offices as well as Zonal offices. Due to unavailability
of data in real time, it was difficult to track procurement activities in various
department/zonal Offices. Moreover, sometimes due to lack of adequate
expertise in guidelines/instructions on procurement, officers were exposed to
disciplinary actions.
Accordingly, as a systemic improvement measure, it has been decided by the Bank
of India to constitute a procurement cell at central location with a committee for
vetting all Request for Proposal (RfP).
Moreover, all the procurement details will be captured on a separate portal
for ready reference and reporting purposes. The Learning and Development
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 119
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Department to conduct a training program on RfP process in co-ordination with
IT Department and Premises Department for Officers from departments at Head
Office and Mumbai based Zones dealing with procurement.
National Insurance Company Limited (NICL)
7.29 NICL has introduced an online Vigilance Complaints system through the
Company website. It has enhanced customer convenience and transparency in
complaint management.
Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)
7.30 For providing Direct Credit to Micro Enterprises under Partnership Arrangement
(PA), Prayaas Scheme has been launched with significant digitization of the
entire credit delivery process and seamless process integrations between the
concerned Enterprises and SIDBI.
7.31 GST Sahay - The application facilitates 'on tap' invoice-based (cash flow based)
small value credit to micro enterprises as a paperless journey from origination
to repaying using trade data from GSTN, bank information through Account
Aggregator, Credit bureau status, e-sign, e-stamping, e-NACH etc.
7.32 SIDBI has introduced Loan Document Software, which is integrated with the core
service provided by National e-Governance Services Limited (NeSL) and Digital
Document Execution (DDE) process. DDE is a technology based secured platform
for automated completion of legal documentation. It is a single window concept
from execution of a document, stamping, signing and automated transfer of the
executed document.
Punjab National Bank (PNB)
7.33 To prevent cyber frauds, a functionality has been developed, wherein data of
suspect Registry created by MHA is shared to-and-fro on real-time basis. To
alert the user, a pop-up message is displayed as under to the user whenever any
account appearing in Suspect Registry is added as beneficiary using IBS/MBS/
UPI as well as for Quick transfer through MBS:
“ALERT! You might be doing a transaction to a fraudster account. This account
has been reported over National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. Therefore, please
exercise due caution & care.”
120 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
7.34 It was observed that obtaining transit permits for transport of timber and
forest produce from one state to another state along the route was a very timeconsuming process as it was based on state specific transit rules on the route of
transition.
Each state had their own transit regulations, which required a separate transit
pass issued in each state for transporting timber and forest produce.
The Ministry envisioned a "One Nation-One Pass" regime to enable seamless
transit across the country. A web-based portal to facilitate the seamless transit
of timber, bamboo, and other forest produce across the country through a
unified online mode will contribute for ease of doing business for tree growers
and farmers involved in agroforestry.
This National Transit Pass System (NTPS) has a role-based and workflow-based
web application available in desktop as well as mobile application. The User
can register an online application for the issuance of Transit Permit (TP) or No
Objection Certificate (NOC) through web-portal and mobile application.
The application has also facility for online application for Species grown on
private land which are exempted from transit pass regime as well as the Species
grown on private land which are not exempted from transit pass regime. The
application will generate online Transit Permit or NOC based on category of
species. The application has facility of E-payment to pay user fees.
NTPC Limited
7.35 Irregularities have been observed in the sub-vendor approval without adequate
verification of their documents. This raises concerns about the potential selection
of unqualified vendors for critical equipment, auxiliaries, systems, and boughtout items, affecting the quality and performance of the supplied goods.
To address the issue, the organization devised a revised process for approving
sub-vendors based on a detailed evaluation of the Sub-Qualifying Requirement
(Sub QR) documents, including Performance Certificates submitted by the main
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 121
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
contractor. The approval process now incorporates thorough checks to ensure
that the vendors meet necessary technical and performance criteria.
A new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been implemented for reviewing
sub-vendor qualifications which provides clear guidelines for the Engineering
Department to verify the submitted credentials and supporting documents,
ensuring that the sub-vendor meets the required standards before approval.
This has enhanced the quality of approved vendors, reduced the risk of using
unqualified vendors, and improved the overall integrity of the procurement
process.
Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID)
7.36 Non standardization of documents in support of eligibility criteria of geographical
presence in particular regions for manpower-based Contracts was observed in
POWERGRID.
As a systemic improvement measure and to bring more transparency, a list of
acceptable documents has been finalized/standardized to ensure geographical
presence of bidders during bid evaluation.
Implementation of this measure has ensured transparent evaluation process
and eliminated discretion in awarding such Regional Contracts.
Enforcement Directorate (ED)
7.37 The E-DOTS (Electronic Data and Operations Tracking System) has been
implemented to centralize data of all cases under investigations within the
Enforcement Directorate (ED). This centralized system ensures streamlining case
tracking, enhanced coordination, and availability of relevant data in real time for
efficient decision-making and ensuring time bound completion of investigation
processes.
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL)
7.38 The vigilance department at BCCL identified non-rotation of executives and nonexecutives in sensitive posts across various departments beyond the stipulated
3-year period, increasing the risk of misconduct.
122 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Earlier manual review processes had data integrity and compliance gaps. To
address this, an automated alert system in the SAP (HR) module was implemented
to ensure timely rotation and enhance transparency.
The system auto-generates alerts based on predefined rules, providing reports
on officials in sensitive posts, those eligible for rotation, and those exceeding the
tenure limit. These reports are periodically shared with subsidiary and area-level
officials for continuous monitoring and compliance.
MMTC Limited
7.39 As a special drive during a Vigilance Awareness Week campaign, inspection
of more than 200 pending cases highlighted delays in execution petitions,
unresolved cheque bounce cases, and weak legal responses.
MMTC’s outdated legal expense policy (since 1988) was found to have led to
unchecked legal expenditures. Key issues observed include arbitrary selection
of legal professionals, discretionary fee fixation without competitive bids,
inadequate documentation, and post facto payment approvals, with no updated
fee schedule, resulting in inflated payments compared to other CPSEs.
Following vigilance intervention, MMTC introduced a new empanelment policy
with an approved fee schedule in March 2024, along with audits, performance
reviews, and repatriation of deputed law officers.
Corrective actions were taken including legal training, detective agency hiring,
fresh appeals, and recoveries through district authorities. Improved coordination
between legal and operational divisions was ensured for timely actions and
effective litigation management.
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL)
7.40 At HPCL loading locations, dip elimination is based on the accuracy of flow
meters at tank truck (TT) loading gantries, requiring only 5% of loaded TTs to be
physically checked once approval is granted.
The absence of a monitoring system for the efficacy of dip elimination led to
erratic loading and opportunities for unauthorized excess loading.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 123
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
As a systemic improvement measure, Supply Operation and Distribution (SOD)
Strategic Business Unit (SBU) was advised to implement periodic revalidation of
dip elimination approvals instead of perpetual approvals. HPCL has now mandated
renewal of approvals every three years by HQO, with annual revalidation by
Zones.
Only if 99% of the TTs loaded at location are within the acceptable limit of +/-
0.01% variation, dip elimination approval is validated/renewed. In case variation
is beyond these limits, all TTs loaded at location are to be verified by the officer
manually before dispatching to customer.
These guidelines ensure accurate loading, prevent malpractice, and maintain
operational integrity at supply locations.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)
7.41 BPCL identified the following key issues in LPG distribution:
(i) Underweight Cylinders/Pilferage: Customers often receive LPG cylinders
weighing less than 14.2 kg.
(ii) Diversion of Cylinders: Cylinders are illegally diverted despite delivery
notifications.
(iii) Overcharging and Poor Service: Complaints of overcharging and lack of
pre-delivery checks (weight, valve, and ‘O’ ring leaks).
To address these, BPCL introduced a tamper-proof seal with a QR code for
cylinder tracking from plant to customer. Customers can scan the code during
delivery to verify authenticity. An intact seal confirms "Pure for Sure" (PFS),
while a tampered seal disables the code, alerting customers not to accept the
cylinder. A Delivery Partner App ensures secure deliveries through geo-tagging,
OTP verification, real-time tracking, pre-delivery checks, and e-cash memos.
Customers can book slots, verify pricing, and provide feedback via the app.
The system enhances delivery transparency, quality assurance, and customer
satisfaction, with continuous monitoring for compliance.

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Indian Bank
7.42 The end-to-end automation of Disciplinary Process/Vigilance System is
undertaken during the year to track the cases on a real-time basis and to plug
the gaps in the existing system. In part one, portal has been developed for
automatically fetching the NPA accounts from CBS (Core Banking Solution).
Through the portal the official will be allotted for conducting Staff Accountability
(SA) Study and the investigating official will conduct the SA study and submit the
report along with lapses identified if any in the portal itself. The lapses will be
carried forward to Part II for issuing Letter of Explanation (LOE) and proceeding
further Disciplinary Process.
7.43 It has been observed that a few staff are involved in online gaming or betting
apps and subsequently losing money and becoming in-debt. To compensate for
the same, some staff were involved in fraudulent activity of misappropriating the
customer's money. In this regard, as a systemic improvement measure, offsite
monitoring has been set up for monitoring such transactions observed in staff
accounts and accounts of their family members and initiating corrective action
thereon.
7.44 For appraising the quality or purity of jewels for providing Jewel Loans, Branch
officials are entirely dependent on Jewel Appraisers. It has been observed that
some appraisers are committing fraud in such cases. To curb the same, Bank has
introduced Mobile App through which the jewel appraisers will enter the details
of ornaments pledged and its weight, purity and photo of the jewels pledged
will be captured.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC)
7.45 As per the terms & conditions of the third-party testing of material in DMRC, it
is to be done from NABL accredited laboratories only. However, it was observed
that NABL accreditation is granted to a laboratory only for specific lab tests. In
DMRC, attention was not being given to the aspect that the concerned lab has
accreditation of NABL for particular lab test which is being referred for testing.
As a systemic improvement measure, guidelines have been issued by DMRC
which provides that the materials should be sent to testing to those Labs only
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 125
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
where valid NABL accreditation is available for the specific test. Now, the process
of testing materials at third party labs has been more streamlined and quality is
being maintained as per the specification required for the material.
7.46 In Electrical and S&T contracts of DMRC, the product is accepted based on Type
Tests certificates submitted and Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) conducted at
Contractor's premises. This provision of third-party testing was not standard
practice in Electrical and S&T contracts which resulted in supply of materials
which failed during testing on some parameters.
As systemic improvements, due diligence in execution of contract is being
observed to ensure supplied items at site have valid information printed on
wires/name plates of various equipment as per approved Guaranteed Technical
Parameter (GTP) in accordance with contract conditions. A policy for third-Party
Testing has been formulated to ensure better quality and performance of wires/
equipment/components ensuring material meeting the required criteria for use
in services.
7.47 During an investigation, it was observed that in a tender involving "Installation,
Testing & Commissioning of Ballastless Track including Supply of fastening
system", the definition of similar work in NIT was stipulated as "Installation,
Testing & Commissioning of Ballastless track work on MRTS or main line of
passenger Railways System".
The definition of 'similar work' was not in line with the scope of work of tender
and no weightage was given to supply component in the tender which covered
approx. 38% of total scope of work.
As a systemic improvement measure, a guideline has been issued for
standardization of definition of ‘similar work’ in tenders of Track Department.
The definition of 'similar work' in NIT has been standardized and it is now in line
with the scope of work of tender which has led to uniformity in the eligibility
criteria in track tenders.
Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)
7.48 It was observed that Clause 6(a) of Chapter I of Sub Delegation of Powers (SDOP)
2022 of BEL mentions that product advertisement proposals including Product
126 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Brochures/Promotional video films etc. for sales promotion may be approved
subject to “Corporate Policy” on product advertisement. However, there was no
such policy formulated in BEL.
Further, product advertisement proposals were being approved as per SDOP. To
achieve a more structured approach towards advertising and brand building in
alignment with Company's core values and brand identity, BEL has formulated
Advertisement Policy. This covers the procedure for approval for advertisements
in print media, electronic media, events and conferences, direct marketing etc.
The policy also covers different types of advertisements e.g. newspaper display,
tender, recruitment, product booklets, media releases etc. Approval process and
its review mechanism have also been covered in the policy.
7.49 BEL, in course of manufacturing for defense applications, requires development
of new products based on latest technologies. In a few instances, it was noticed
that the vendor base was not developed thoroughly for new product/technology
by inviting Expression of Interest (EOI) through Open Tender. Instead, email
inquiries for EOI were invited from selected group of vendors based on available
vendor base. This in turn was limiting opportunity for the organization to explore
the market for new products/technologies. Accordingly, based on nature of the
product/item/technology, BEL is pro-actively developing vendor base adhering
to the provisions of Outsourcing and Vendor Development Policy of Purchase
Procedure 2016. Invitation of EOI is being resorted to on specific cases with
approval of competent authority.
MECON Limited
7.50 Irregularities were observed in consideration of names of officials in MECON
Ltd in a particular grade in promotion list during year 2016/17 wherein most of
the officials considered for promotion for a particular grade and subsequently
were made ineligible. For this purpose, as a systemic improvement measure the
following steps have been taken:
a) Any amendment to promotion policy should be done only before the
constitution of DPC for any particular year.
b) All promotion policies should be circulated on common platforms.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 127
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
c) Effective date for any policy should be indicated clearly.
d) List of eligible candidates and number of vacancies in all grades should be
finalized prior to DPC formation and reference of same shall be made in
DPC constitution note.
e) HR employees who are also eligible for the promotion in a particular year
may be kept detached from the promotion related activities specially for
Initiating notes/ approval etc.
f) Any amendment made in the promotion policy should be valid for a
minimum of 3 years to avoid any undue advantage/disadvantage to the
candidates of subsequent years.
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)
7.51 It was observed that the responsibility for conducting 'test checks' by Project
Directors is not clearly defined in the duties of Project Directors outlined in
existing policy circular of NHAI.
Checks to be undertaken by NHAI officials should clearly be defined for evaluation
of the prescribed performance of Independent Engineers (IE), so that payments
to IE's can be linked to outcome and not only through the current attendancebased system.
As a systemic improvement measure, guidelines regarding Test Checks by Project
Director have been made applicable for Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) (Toll),
Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) and Engineering, Procurement and Construction
(EPC) contracts. The Project Director himself will witness a random Test Check
of 3% of the measurements before making payment of any running/final bill
and additional 5% test checks be undertaken by other NHAI's Technical Officers
posted at Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
Department of Posts
7.52 In Maharashtra Circle, a fraud case had come to notice in which mis-appropriation
of deposited amount in Postal Life insurance was observed.
In Department of Posts, McCamish application is used for collecting premiums
128 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
for Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI). As the
McCamish and Core System Integrator (CSI) was not integrated earlier, the
transactions carried out in McCamish were not automatically reflected in the
Daily Account generated at the Sub Post Office/Branch Post Office/Head Post
Office. Consequently, the transactions/collection of premiums so made in
McCamish were to be posted (voucher posting) through utility tool (an option
made available for the purpose). Once the McCamish transactions were posted,
only thereafter, the same were reflected in Daily Account of the respective
office, giving an opportunity to the delinquent official(s) to mis-appropriate. In
some cases, voucher posting of deposit transactions were not carried out and
transactions were not taken into the Government Account. While there is no loss
to the insurant in such cases, the Government funds were mis-appropriated.
As a Systemic improvement measure, the PLI-CSI has been integrated with
McCamish application. Now, all transactions in McCamish application are posted
automatically in respective General Ledger Codes and there is no need to upload
in SAP through utility tool. This has prevented the non-accounting of PLI/RPLI
premium deposits and misappropriation of the same.
Central Public Works Department (CPWD)
7.53 In a case, it was observed that quotations for specialized work were invited from
composite category contractors and non-specialized agencies. While approval
for calling of quotation was obtained from the quotation accepting authority,
the eligibility and other terms and conditions mentioned in Notice for Inviting
Quotation (NIQ) were framed by junior officials without getting the approval
from the quotation accepting authority. This resulted in award of work order to
ineligible agency.
As a systemic improvement measure, now, it has been provided in the CPWD
Works Manual that NIQ with Terms & Conditions should be approved by the
quotation accepting authority before inviting quotations.

CHAPTER 8
PARTICIPATIVE VIGILANCE -
VIGILANCE AWARENESS WEEK
BACKGROUND
“ln the long run, the fight against corruption will succeed only to the extent to
which a favorable social climate is created. When such a climate is created and
corruption becomes abhorrent to the minds of the public and the public servants
and social controls become effective, other administrative, disciplinary and
punitive measures may become unimportant and may be relaxed and reduced
to a minimum.”
(Excerpt from the Santhanam Committee Report − 1964)
8.1 The Central Vigilance Commission is of the firm view that a lasting solution for
eradication of corruption from public life can only be found if anti−corruption
strategies are developed with active participation of all stakeholders of society.
Support and involvement of public is therefore an essential ingredient in the
fight to eradicate corruption from society.
8.2 As a measure to create awareness amongst public about the harmful effects
of corruption and to engage them in development and implementation of
effective strategies for eliminating corruption, the Commission started observing
Vigilance Awareness Week every year, to coincide with the birth anniversary of
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Home Minister of independent India. It is an
opportunity to recognize the role of every individual citizen in the battle against
corruption and in promoting governance with integrity. It is not only an occasion
to carry forward the Commission’s initiatives across the country but also to
encourage the citizen to join hands with the Commission in its endeavors.

During the last 10 years, we have focused our efforts on leveraging technology
and e-governance to create a transparent and accountable eco-system. We have
furthered the spirit of ethics and integrity to strengthen our institutions. As we

SPECIAL CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIGILANCE AWARENESS WEEK
- 2024
8.5 The Central Vigilance Commission is of the view that preventive vigilance
measures are essential to maintain transparency, accountability, efficiency
and objectivity in public life. These objectives can only be achieved if proper
systems and procedures are in place. Keeping in view the above, a three months
campaign was initiated by the Commission associated with Vigilance Awareness
Week.
8.6 The Commission issued advisory vide circular dated 01.08.2024 to all
organisations to start a three−month campaign from 16.08.2024 to 15.11.2024
focusing on specific preventive vigilance measures. Five major areas identified
for focused attention with actionable points are summarized below: −
Capacity Building Programs
8.7 The Commission is of the view that a robust training system for employees is
important for any organisation to succeed in its objective and functioning. This
year, the Commission focused on Capacity Building of employees who have
been newly recruited in the last few years on key aspects of preventive vigilance.
Ministries/Departments/Organisations were advised to conduct structured
training programme for fresh inductees. It was also advised to conduct refresher
training programme for employees on completion of ten years of services.
Organisations were advised to emphasize on training related to topics like Ethics
& Governance/ Conduct Rules/ Systems and Procedures of the organisation/
Cyber Hygiene, Security/ and Procurement. 246 organizations had organized
2942 such training programmes during VAW 2024.
Identification and Implementation of Systemic Improvement Measures
8.8 For a proactive approach in the fight against corruption, preventive vigilance
initiative is one of the most important tool. To achieve this goal, the organisations
were advised to analyze cases of last 05 years for identification of areas prone
136 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
to corruption and for implementation of systemic improvements. Besides, the
Commission had also advised for conducting a special drive for implementation
of systemic improvement measures which were previously advised by the
Commission.
Updation of Circulars/Guidelines/Manuals
8.9 The Commission has been emphasing on preparation of manuals by respective
organisations in areas of critical importance such as contracts, procurement,
recruitment etc. The organisations were again advised to work towards
identification of circulars/guidelines/manuals which were required to be updated
and to take required steps to bring them in sync with the policy guidelines issued
by the Commission and other Government agencies from time to time.
Disposal of Complaints
8.10 Complaints are vital source of information which help in curbing unethical and
corrupt practices. Hence, promptness in processing and disposal of complaints
is of paramount importance to ensure that the guilty are brought to book at
the earliest possible. Such prompt action would also make sure that the honest
officials do not remain under the shadow of suspicion.
8.11 To ensure disposal of complaints without delay, the Commission initiated
campaign to bring all complaints pending as on 30.06.2024, to logical conclusion
latest by 15.11.2024.
Dynamic Digital Presence
8.12 Citizens/stakeholders visit the website seeking details/information and therefore
all organisation should be prompt in regular up-dation of their website for
greater transparency and better service delivery. The organisation should follow
extant Government guidelines on development and maintenance of websites
(like GIGW 3.0/RBI’s Master Circular on Customer Service in Banks/Security
audit). Commission has suggested following action plan to be taken up during
the campaign period :-
(i) All organisations must make efforts to ensure that their websites are
updated and contain all proper and relevant information.

WEEK
8.21 As part of Vigilance Awareness Week, the Central Vigilance Commission organized

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 139
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
8.24 In her address, Hon’ble President appreciated the three months campaign by
the Commission on Preventive Vigilance. She stated that Vigilance Awareness
Week is organised to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai
Patel, the great nation maker and an efficient administrator. The ideals of Sardar
Patel inspire us to build a great nation. In our culture, a moral life is considered a
meaningful and successful life. The great philosopher and poet Thiruvalluvar has
described wealth earned without harming anyone is a source of happiness. She
also highlighted the quote of Megasthenes written 2300 years ago where he has
mentioned that Indian people obey the rule of law and do not like indiscipline.
8.25 She also mentioned that eternal values of Indian society like honesty, morality,
integrity and transparency have to be strengthened. These life values need to be
nurtured and strengthened more. Trust is the basis of social life. It is a source of
unity and strengthens relationships. Public trust in the work and welfare schemes
of the government gives strength to the government. On the other hand,
corruption is an obstacle to economic growth. It also reduces trust in the society,
reduces brotherhood among people. To eradicate corruption, a comprehensive
approach is required to be adopted. It is the collective responsibility of all of
us to eradicate corruption, for this we will have to go to the root of this cause.
The theme of the VAW-2024 “Culture of Integrity for Nation's Prosperity” :
 “lR;fu"Bk dh laL—fr ls jk"Vª dh le`f)” chosen by the CVC is very apt.
8.26 The Hon’ble President of India added that the Government of India has taken
several measures to tackle corruption. Direct Benefit Transfer has brought
transparency in distribution of welfare schemes. E-tendering has been
implemented in public procurement. Government E Market place has been
started. A Probity Portal is functional. Prevention of Corruption Act has been
amended in the year 2018. Economic Offenders Act has been implemented. The
Government has seized assets more than 12 billion dollars under the Prevention
of Money Laundering Act. She noted that due to policy of zero tolerance against
corruption, corruption will be uprooted.
8.27 She concluded that responsibilities of the Central Vigilance Commission are very
important, and this institution is fulfilling these responsibilities very well. Let us
once again take a pledge that we will completely eradicate corruption and make
India a great nation.

group shared best practices as well as areas of improvement of their organization
which leads to peer learning.
Training Programme for Inquiry Officers/Presenting Officers (IOs/POs)
9.9 The Commission has observed delays in finalization/conclusion of departmental
inquires. The delays could be due to lack of knowledge of conducting inquires,
preparation of memorandum of chargesheet, documents supporting statement
of imputation and witnesses. This comprehensive training of Inquiry Officers
and Presenting Officers is conceived by the Commission with a vision to train
potential IOs and POs across geography to ensure that a trained pool of IOs/POs
are available with the organizations, who could be entrusted the departmental
inquiries, to reduce the time taken in finalization of the departmental inquiries.
9.10 The Commission had formulated a 3-day uniform offline training programme
for IOs/POs of the Govt. organisations including PSUs/PSBs. IO/PO training has
been conducted by identified training institutions namely Institute of Secretariat
Training and Management (ISTM), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited,
CBI Academy, Indian Institute of Bank Management (IIBM), National Productivity
Council (NPC) and National Institute of Communication Finance (NICF). By

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Appendix-IV
(Para 5.9)
SOME IRREGULARITIES OBSERVED, PRIMA FACIE, IN COURSE OF INTENSIVE
EXAMINATIONS AND SCRUTINY OF VARIOUS PROCUREMENT CASES DURING
THE YEAR
1. In a Building work costing around Rs. 151.00 crore, following major irregularities
were observed :-
a) As per the contract, the contractor was required to excavate the hard rock
by mechanical means without blasting. Rate of excavation without blasting
is higher than the rate of excavation with blasting. During execution of
work, the contractor was allowed to do excavation in hard rock by way
of blasting. The payment was made under the BOQ item of excavation
of hard rock without blasting resulting in undue financial benefit to the
contractor.
b) As per the specification for steel reinforcement work provided in the
contract, annealed steel wire required for binding of reinforcement bars
or tack welding used in lieu of binding of reinforcement was not to be
measured for payment as its cost was included in the quoted rates for
reinforcement work. However, payment on account of welding of steel
reinforcement bars was made to the contractor resulting in undue financial
benefit to the contractor.
2. In a Transport Infrastructure development project costing around Rs. 308.00
crore, following major irregularities were observed :-
a) Tenders for four packages were invited simultaneously by a PSU with one
of the eligibility criteria that the bidders shall have Bid Capacity not less
than the estimated cost of the individual package. Eventually, one of the
bidders emerged as lowest bidder in three packages and contracts were
awarded to the bidder. In this case, the bid capacity of this bidder was
only Rs. 466.59 crore. However, the amount of contracts awarded to this
bidder for three packages was Rs. 848.04 crore. There was no provision
in the bid document for the requirement of bid capacity of a bidder,
186 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
who participated in more than one package. Thus, due to lack of proper
provision in the bid document regarding bid capacity, the amount of the
works awarded to this bidder was more than their bid capacity.
b) As per the contract, specified number of technical persons were to be
deployed by the contractor and for non-deployment or shortfall in
deployment, provision for recovery at specified rate was also provided.
Though, there was shortfall in deployment of technical persons but
corresponding recovery amounting to Rs. 63 lakh was not recovered from
the bills of the contractor.
3. In a Runway construction work costing around Rs. 359.00 crore, following
major irregularities were observed :-
a) As per the eligibility criteria prescribed in tender document, bidders were
required to submit the details of completed work in support of their
experience of execution of similar works in the past. One of the bidders
submitted an ongoing work claiming that substantial part of the work is
completed. The work was not completed, still the same was considered as
completed work and the bidder was qualified based on this ongoing work.
Eventually, the same bidder emerged as the lowest and the contract was
awarded to this bidder.
b) It is a percentage rate contract, wherein the contractor was required to
quote the percentage above/ below the estimated cost for various parts/
schedules. The quoted rate for the Earthwork & Excavation Schedule was
65.31% below the estimated cost. However, the payment was being made
at 51.31% below in place of 65.31% below the estimated rate. This has
resulted in overpayment to the contractor.
4. In a multistorey office building work costing around Rs. 67.00 crore, following
major irregularities were observed :-
a) As per the extant policy of the organisation, the eligibility criteria provided
in the tender document for hiring of consultancy services which states
that the bidder should have completed at least one similar nature of work
in the city of proposed building in last 7 years. This condition related to
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 187
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
past experience of execution of similar nature of work in a particular city
was found to be restrictive, as out of 12 participating bidders, only three
bidders could meet the qualifying criteria.
b) As per the eligibility criteria prescribed in tender document, the bidder
should have satisfactorily completed buildings having basement plus
ground plus 5 storeys or more and other allied work. One of the bidders
was considered technically qualified based on the experience of successful
completion of a building having only ground plus 4 storeys. Eventually, this
bidder, who was not meeting the eligibility criteria emerged as the lowest
and contract was awarded to this bidder.
c) As per the contract, the rates quoted by the contractor were inclusive of
all taxes (except GST), labour cess, statutory levy etc. As per Building and
Other Construction Workers' Welfare Cess Rules, 1996, labour cess @1%
of contract value was to be deducted and deposited to the appropriate
authority. However, ‘Labour Welfare Cess’ was not recovered from the
bills of the contractor.
d) The site of subject work is situated in the area under earthquake Zone-III.
Accordingly, as per BIS Code of Practice for Ductile Design and Detailing of
Reinforced Concrete Structures Subject to Seismic Forces (Clause 7.1.1 of IS
13920: 2016), the minimum dimension of a column shall not be less than 20
d, where d is diameter of the largest diameter longitudinal reinforcement
bar in the beam passing through or anchoring into the column at the joint,
or 300 mm. It is observed that columns having size 250mm x 250mm were
provided for supporting the overhead water storage tanks (OHT) at the
terrace of the building. Thus, the codal provision was not followed.
5. In a Hydropower project costing around Rs. 1051.00 crore, following major
irregularities were observed :-
a) As per the contract, the cost of construction and maintenance of approach
roads for Power House, Shafts and Adits were included in the quoted rates
of the contractor and no payment was to be made to the contractor on this
account. However, payment was made to the contractor for maintenance
of these access roads resulting in undue financial benefit to the contractor.
188 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
b) As per the contract, the land for dumping sites was required to be made
available to the contractor free of cost. The contractor was to construct
gabion walls, retaining walls, boulder pitching, drainage, etc. at dumping
sites as per requirement of local statutory authorities and plan formulated
for disposal of muck under Environmental Management Plan (EMP) at no
separate/ extra payment. However, payment of Rs. 60.52 lakh was made
to the contractor for dumping site protection works resulting in undue
financial benefit to the contractor.
6. In a work of construction of office building and training centre costing around
Rs. 1356.15 crore, following major irregularities were observed :-
a) As per the Works Manual of the organisation, if there is a significant
component in the work other than normal building work, it will be
considered as a component of the work for the purpose of definition
of similar work in which the bidders were required to possess relevant
experience. The subject work has component of Mechanical, Electrical
and Plumbing (MEP) services of more than 30% of total project cost, but
the experience of MEP services was not included in the eligibility criteria
for the bidders. Thus, the eligibility criteria fixed for the bidders was
not as per the organisation’s Works Manual and as a consequence, the
experience of the bidders in MEP services could not be assessed.
b) The office building has three basements and the building for training
centre has two basements. The contract for this work was awarded
under EPC mode. As per the contract, the anchors were to be provided
in diaphragm wall at each basement level. The anchors were provided
in only two basements in office building and in one basement in training
centre building; however, full payment for anchors was released to the
contractor resulting in inadmissible payment to the contractor.
c) As per the payment schedule prescribed in the contract, for office building,
cost of construction of 1410 meter long diaphragm wall was worked out to
be Rs. 35.57 crore. During execution of work the alignment of diaphragm
wall was changed, due to which the length of diaphragm wall was reduced
to 1282 meter only, for which corresponding amount comes out to be
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 189
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Rs. 32.34 crore. However, Rs. 32.97 crore have been paid to the contractor
resulting in overpayment of Rs. 63 lakh.
d) As per the payment schedule prescribed in the contract, Rs. 26.61 crore
was apportioned for waterproofing of walls of all three basements in office
building and Rs. 1.2 crore for waterproofing cost of walls of two basements
of training centre building. However, no waterproofing was done on
basement walls, but 100% payment for waterproofing of basement walls
was released to the contractor.
7. In a work for construction of road bed, bridges etc. costing around Rs. 567.00
crore, following major irregularities were observed :-
a) The work was awarded to a joint venture of three firms (lead partner
having 50% share and other partners with 40% & 10% share). The JV firm
was qualified on the basis of credentials of all three partners collectively.
Distribution of shares and responsibilities among JV partners was clearly
mentioned in the joint venture agreement. However, the work was being
executed by only one member of JV (having 40% share in JV) and there
was no apparent contribution of the lead partner and third partner in
execution of the work. Thus, apparently the Joint Venture was formed just
to qualify for bidding and bag the contract.
b) The consultant was required to deploy an Environmental Expert to conduct
the required tests for regular monitoring of environmental parameters
(air, water, noise, soil) in and around construction site as per the given
Environmental Management Plan and maintain records of the same.
However, the Environmental Expert was not deployed by the consultant,
as a consequence required monitoring of environmental parameters
was not done. Apart from this, implementation of other environmental
protection measures for preserving and relaying the top soil of the borrow
area was also not ensured during the work.
8. In a Project for development of transport infrastructure costing around Rs.
351.00 crore, following major irregularities were observed :-
a) There was a major deviation of approx. 65% in the contract value
as it increased to Rs. 580.14 crore vis-a-vis initial contract value of
190 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Rs. 351.15 crore. Many additional works like modification in foundation
for future expansion of station building, execution of additional platform,
execution of additional piers for future expansion, additional viaduct of
430 meter etc. were executed under this contract, which could have been
planned before inviting tenders or could have been executed under a
separate contract.
b) As per the contract, the contractor was required to use Portland Slag
Cement (PSC) for piles and foundation works. Quantity of 2125 cum M-35
grade concrete was executed using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)
instead of Portland Slag Cement (PSC) for foundation and piling work.
Portland Slag Cement (PSC) offers excellent resistance to sulphate and
chloride attacks. Thus, by not using PSC which was also envisaged in the
contract, durability of the structures was compromised.
c) The required number of tests were not conducted on various materials i.e.
reinforcement bars, stainless steel sections and aluminium sections, etc.
In this case, the cost of testing was to be borne by the contractor. Thus,
not only undue financial benefit has gone to the contractor on account of
saving of the cost of testing, but the quality of these input materials was
also not established properly.
9. In a Building construction work costing around Rs. 24.00 crore, following major
irregularities were observed:-
a) As per the scope of work provided in Engineering, Procurement and
Construction (EPC) contract, structural glazing work and façade work
were in the scope of the contractor. The façade work at the roof slab was
reduced/ descoped, however, corresponding cost adjustment on account
of reduction in scope was not done from the bills of the contractor. The
contractor was required to provide Aluminium Composite Panels (ACP)
along with Aluminium frame in structural Glazing work and façade work.
However, in place of ACP, Metal Composite Panels (MCP) were provided
without any corresponding cost adjustment. These deviations from the
approved drawings resulted in undue financial benefit to the contractor.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 191
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
b) The contractor was required to provide RFID based boom barrier at entry
and exit of the building. The contractor was also required to provide
Photovoltaic Solar System on the rooftop of the building. However, neither
RFID based boom barrier nor Photovoltaic Solar System were provided by
the contractor and the corresponding cost adjustment was also not done
from the bills of the contractor.
10. In a bridge construction work costing around Rs. 1292.00 crore, following
major irregularities were observed:-
a) As per the contract, the project was to be completed within 3 years and
6 months from the appointed date. Project completion schedule was
divided into four project milestones and penal action was provisioned in
the contract for non-achievement of prescribed milestones. The contractor
failed to achieve 1st & 2nd project milestones for which Rs. 50 crore was
withheld from the bills of the contractor. However, on the request of the
contractor, not only the withheld amount was released but withholding
of any further amount was also deferred. For expediting the progress of
the work, on the request of the contractor, an interest-bearing advance
of Rs. 97 crore was also paid to the contractor. However, the progress of
execution of work could not be improved by the contractor. Thus, payment
of this advance was not only beyond the contract provisions but it also did
not yield any result.
b) The contract document provides that the price adjustment shall be due
and payable up to the scheduled completion date including any time
extension granted. The last extension was approved up to September
2022 and after that, no extension was approved by the organisation. Thus,
price variation was applicable up to September 2022 only, but it was paid
up to April 2024. Thus, the payment on account of price variation beyond
September 2022 was inadmissible.
11. In a refinery expansion project, following irregularity was observed :-
As per the contract, the mobilization advance up to 10% of the total contract
value amounting to Rs. 53.23 crore was to be released in two equal installments.
192 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Next installment was to be released only after submission of certificate of
satisfactory utilization of previous installment. However, instead of releasing the
mobilization advance in two equal installments, the first and second installments
of mobilization advance were released for Rs. 48.39 crore and Rs. 14.42 crore
respectively. While the 1st installment paid was of unduly high value, the
utilisation certificate was also not insisted before releasing the 2nd installment.
12. In a work related to construction of a hospital building costing around Rs.
809.00 crore, following irregularities were observed :-
a) One of the bidders submitted the work order and experience certificate
related to a work completed by them in support of the experience
along with the bid. During evaluation of the bids, the same experience
certificate was found to be fake/ false. The issue was discussed in Tender
Scrutiny Committee (TSC) and the TSC mentioned in their report that
the certificate issuing authority has conveyed that the said certificate
submitted by the bidder was not issued by them. Thus, a false/ fabricated/
incorrect document was submitted by the bidder with its bid. As per the
affidavit submitted by the bidder, in case, any document, information
&/or certificate submitted by the bidder is found to be incorrect/ false/
fabricated, the organisation at its discretion may disqualify/reject/
terminate the bid/ contract and also forfeit the EMD/all dues. In this case,
the bid of this bidder was rejected but EMD was not forfeited. Thus, action
taken against the bidder was not in line with the provisions of the bid
document resulting in financial loss to the organisation.
b) The structural steel work was executed at the site without obtaining the
required approval and vetting of the drawings. Further, required tests on
the weld joints were also not conducted. Thus, the quality of this structural
steel work could not be established properly.
13. In a work of a transport infrastructure facility costing around Rs. 565.00 crore,
following major irregularity was observed :-
As per the consultancy contract, if the variation in the project cost is more
than 10% and up to 20% of estimated cost, a recovery at the prescribed rate
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 193
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
was to be made from the bills of the consultant. In case the variation is more
than 20%, organisation reserves the right to initiate other administrative/penal
action including debarment. The anticipated cost of the project was Rs. 803.75
crore, which is a 24.46 % increase over the tendered amount of the work. In
spite of such huge deviation beyond permissible limit of 10%, no such action as
prescribed was taken against the consultant.
14. In a marine infrastructure development work costing around Rs. 400.00 crore,
following major irregularities were observed:-
a) Conditions prevailing at work site fall under category of extreme exposure
and for the extreme exposure minimum cement content in the cement
concrete prescribed in contract was 420 Kg/cum. However, concrete with
401 kg/cum of cement was allowed to be used in the superstructure of
the building. This will not only affect the durability of the structure, but
undue financial benefit has also gone to the contractor as the contract
was on EPC mode.
b) As per the contract, minimum 8 meter high barricading was to be provided
on the periphery of work area to avoid disturbance to the adjoining
residential and operational areas. However, only 3 to 4 m high barricading
was provided at site. Thus, not only the basic purpose of provision of the
barricading was defeated, but undue financial benefit has also gone to the
contractor.
c) As per the contract, either Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) 53 grade or
Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) was to be used in the work. During prebid meeting, prospective bidders sought clarification regarding use of fly
ash in the cement concrete to be produced at site but it was clarified that
fly ash will not be permitted. However, during execution of work fly ash
was permitted to be used in the cement concrete produced at site. It is an
undue financial benefit to the contractor.
d) Deep cracks were developed in RCC deck slab which is indicative of poor
quality control during construction.
194 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
15. In a work for construction of Hospital building costing around Rs. 200.00 crore,
following major irregularities were observed:-
a) As per the bid document, the bidders were required to submit the solvency
certificate of minimum Rs. 98 crore issued by the bank after publishing the
tender. One of the bidders had submitted a solvency certificate of required
amount which was issued by the bank 3 days prior to the publishing of
tender. Clarification was sought from the bidder, who in turn submitted
the clarification from the issuing bank that the solvency certificate was
valid up to a date, which was much beyond the publishing of the tender.
However, the organisation decided to ignore the offer of this bidder, who
claimed that the price quoted by them was Rs. 3.05 crore lower than the
quoted price of the bidder whom the contract was awarded. Thus, an
otherwise eligible bidder was ignored and purportedly the contract was
awarded at higher rate.
b) As per the bid document, the contract agreement was to be signed
within 15 days of issue of Letter of Acceptance and failure to do so will
constitute sufficient grounds for annulment of the award and forfeiture
of bid security. The agreement was not signed within the prescribed time.
However, no action was taken against the contractor.
c) As per the contract, the secured advance up to 75% of assessed value
of non-perishable materials can be released to the contractor on supply
of material. Granite stone flooring work was to be executed under the
contract, wherein stone component cost is about 50% of complete item
rate quoted by the contractor. However, the secured advance on granite
stone was paid under part rate @ 70% of contractor’s quoted rates against
the supply only. It is an undue benefit to the contractor by releasing excess
payment on supply of material beyond the contract provisions.
d) As per site condition, gap of 725mm between the raft and grade slab was
required to be filled by the contractor. Available earth could have been
used for filling this gap as there are hardly any chances of settlement in
slab because of lesser depth of filling. However, in place of using available
earth for filling, sand and fly ash were used for which Rs. 2.23 crore was
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 195
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
paid under extra item on market rate. Thus, due to use of sand and fly ash
in place of available earth, organization had to suffer financial loss as the
intended purpose could have been solved by using available earth also.
e) The contractor was required to open a separate dedicated bank account
in any Nationalized Bank before release of mobilization/ tools & plants
advance. Maintaining the dedicated bank account is required to ensure
utilisation of these advance payments exclusively for this project for
facilitating smooth and timely completion of work. However, no such
dedicated account was opened and maintained by the contractor.
16. In a service contract for hiring of Mechanized Housekeeping Service on
outsource basis costing around Rs. 4.63 crore, the following major irregularities
were observed: -
a) As per the eligibility criteria provided in the bid document, the bidder must
have work experience of deployment of 700 manpower per year for each
of the last 05 years. However, in this case, only 68 persons were required
by the organisation for 02 years. Thus, the eligibility requirement of 700
manpower found to be restrictive in nature and limiting the competition.
b) There was no provision available in the contract document for releasing
overtime to housekeeping staff. However, payment for overtime was
regularly paid by organisation to the service provider. Thus, undue financial
benefit was extended to the contractor.
17. In a work related to Design, Engineering, Manufacture, Supply and Supervision
of Erection, Testing & Commissioning of Vertical Pressure Filters costing around
Rs. 60.00 crore, the following major irregularities were observed:-
a) A PSU was appointed as a consultant on Nomination basis twice in this
project for preparation of Techno-Economic Feasibility Report (TEFR) and
for providing Detail Engineering & Consultancy Services for installation of
4 Nos of Pressure Filters.
b) The tender document was not sent to Embassies and Global Tender Enquiry
(GTE) was floated for less than Rs. 200 crore value without the approval
196 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
of the Competent Authority. Also, clauses w.r.t Public Procurement
(Preference to Make in India) order, 2017 was not incorporated in the
tender document.
c) It was observed that Vertical Pressure Filters were purchased by the
organisation for the first time, but AMC/ CMC clause was not kept in the
tender document as such rates of the same were not available in the
contract/ work order for guidance of the consignee to enable him to enter
AMC/ CMC contract with supplier after warranty period.
d) The organisation has not included the procurement of auxiliary units
such as air compressor, air receiver, membrane compression & utilities,
refrigerant type dryer etc. in the NIT. However, organisation had
separately negotiated the rates for supply of these auxiliary items and
TEC recommended for purchase of the auxiliary items at negotiated rates
and get approval of the competent authority (Board of Directors) which
does not appear to be in order considering the value of the additional
procurement of Rs.4,95,00,000/- .
e) The amendment was issued almost a year after issuing Purchase Order
(PO) for amending supply of pumps with High Tension (HT) motors instead
of Low Tension (LT) Motors. The Consultant should have worked out the
requirement at the specification preparation stage itself. The need to make
the change at a later stage has delayed the commissioning of the project.
f) Tender Evaluating Committee during Techno-commercial evaluation of
the offers had accepted both offers received against this tender with
some deviation from NIT, but the deviations were not made part of the
Purchase/ Work Orders issued to the successful bidder.
18. In a work related to design, engineering, manufacture, supply, transportation,
erection, testing and commissioning of 1 No. spare Generator Transformer
costing around Rs. 13.55 crore, following major irregularities were observed:-
a) In this case, to procure the Generating Transformer immediately
considering the urgency, procurement was made from a PSU on a single
tender basis. However, inordinate delay was observed in the Erection
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 197
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
and Commissioning. The envisaged advantage of procurement through
single tender in urgency, instead of going for open tender, is completely
defeated as single tender might have provided lesser Value for Money
(VfM) as compared to Limited Tender Enquiry/Open Tender Enquiry.
b) It was observed that there are many manufacturers of Generating
Transformers who are making transformers as required in this case. Also,
Transformer is a stand-alone item in this case and need not to be of the
same manufacturer as that of existing one. Still, the transformer was
procured from a particular source through issue of Proprietary Article
Certificate (PAC).
c) It was observed that bids were received through e-mail instead of inviting
the bids through any e-procurement website.
d) The completion period was extended five times for approximately 17
months, but the validity extension of Performance Security was not taken
from the supplier.
19. In a work related to supply, installation, testing and commissioning and
maintenance of hardware infrastructure of Data Centre & Disaster Recovery
Centre, costing around Rs 41.60 crore, following irregularities were observed :-
a) As per eligibility criteria provided in the bid document, bidder should
have experience of having supplied & implemented Server in at least one
Scheduled Commercial Bank with at least 1000 branches or Public Sector
Unit in the last 5 years. However, it is observed that one of the bidders
had submitted experience certificate related to a work which was neither
executed in a Scheduled Commercial Bank nor executed in a Public Sector
Unit. Still, the bidder was considered qualified based on this work. Thus,
irregularity in evaluation of the offers was observed.
b) All the bidders quoted their bid price in the range of Rs 80 crore to Rs 85
crore. Organisation fixed the base price for e-Reverse Auction (e-RA) as Rs
42.20 crore based on reference PO’s of another organisation. After e-RA
the quoted amount of L1 was Rs 41.60 crore. As per e-RA procedure given
in the bid document, start bid price shall be available to the bidders during
198 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
the start of the auction on the auction site. Hence, it appears that bidders
had not quoted their initial bids seriously and were fully dependent on the
Start bid price condition as given in RfP. This means that the lowest initial
price quoted by the bidder has got no sanctity.
20. In a work related to Design, Build and Transfer of TIER III standard Data Centre,
costing around Rs 24.00 crore, following irregularities were observed :-
a) As per financial eligibility criteria provided in the bid document, Bidder
must have a turnover of Rs. 500 crore or above (from Indian Operations
only) in each year during the last three completed financial years. This
turnover requirement of Rs. 500 crore is very high since the project cost
was only Rs. 24 crore.
b) As per the Manual for Procurement of Work issued by Department of
Expenditure, no member of the Tender Evaluation Committee should
be reporting directly to any other member of such Committee. In this
case, the bid evaluation was done by the Tender Evaluation Committee
(TEC) of four officers of one department. Some of the members of the
TEC were directly reporting to others. Thus, the violation of provisions of
procurement Manual was observed in formation of TEC.
21. In a work related to Design, Manufacture, SITC of Turbines, Generators,
Associated Accessories and Auxiliaries, Auxiliary Electrical Equipment,
Mechanical Equipment, 400 KV GIS, 400 KV Outdoor Pothead Yard Equipment,
costing around Rs 552 crore, following irregularities were observed : -
a) The Tender Evaluation Committee has verified from the Internet (through
Wikipedia) the experience certificate of Hydroelectric project submitted
by the bidder, which does not appear to be an authentic source.
Moreover, another work experience certificate submitted by the bidder
does not clearly state whether the work was executed as a Joint Venture
or consortium member. Without ascertaining the past experience of the
bidder, the firm was qualified.
b) The contractor, while submitting the invoice for the reimbursement of
Erection All Risk Policy premium, has added an overhead of 20% on the
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 199
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
policy premium paid to the insurance firm. However, no such provision is
mentioned in the contract document.
22. In a work related to erection, testing and commissioning of Electro- Mechanical
equipment along with auxiliaries and associated equipment costing around Rs
37.43 crore, following irregularities were observed: -
a) As per Pre-Qualification Requirement (PQR), bidder should have
experience of Successful Erection, Testing & Commissioning work
involving Mechanical, Electrical (Building up of stator & rotor at site along
with testing etc.) and C&I Works and installation & commissioning of all
other auxiliaries and associated equipment, including Main Inlet Valve, in
at least 1 (one) Hydro Generating Unit of capacity 50 MW or above of any
Government/ Public Sector Enterprises within a period of 10 (Ten) years.
However, it is seen that the bidder has submitted performance certificates
of a private company. Thus, evaluation of the offers was not done as per
PQR defined in the bid document.
b) In this case, Storage cum Erection All Risk (EAR) Policy was made part of
Bill of Quantities (BOQ) for which the contractor quoted premium amount
of Rs 1.26 crore (approx.). However, the contractor took insurance with a
premium amount of Rs 70 Lakh (approx.) but was paid as per the quoted
amount of Rs 1.26 crore. Further, there was a need to renew the EAR policy
for the remaining work due to delay in the erection work. Accordingly,
a proposal was initiated by the officials for extension of the above EAR
policy. In the proposal, officials have added an additional 20% contractor
profit on the renewal amount of EAR policy without any such provision in
the contract resulting in undue financial benefit to the contractor.
23. In a work related to supply, installation, commissioning & warranty support of
Surveillance equipment along with OFC network in four cities costing around
Rs. 39.25 crore, following major irregularities were observed :-
a) The members of the consortium have submitted the purchase order of
the project value of Rs. 12.37 crore and another purchase order of value
of Rs. 9.50 crore (having actual executed value only Rs 4.82 crore) along
200 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
with their bid claiming experience of completion of these projects. These
projects do not fulfill the eligibility criteria for completion of two projects
with required value of Rs 10.28 crore each, but the bidder was made
eligible by Tender Evaluation Committee (TEC).
b) The client organisation awarded the work to a PSU. The PSU floated the
tender to engage the back-end contractor for the execution of 22 items
as per scope of work. In the contract between the client organisation
and PSU, the quantity was indicative and there was no limit on quantity
variation, whereas PSU floated the tender with a quantity variation of
25%. Although the back-end contractor’s overall rates were on the lower
side, but the firm quoted the higher rate (2.7% to 178%) for 9 items, out of
22 items compared to the awarded rate to the PSU. During the currency of
the contract, organisation made quantity ‘Nil’ of one item, resulting in PSU
margin reduced from 6.37% to 5.12%. In case, the organisation further
increases the quantity of items in which the rates of back-end contractor
are on higher side and decreases the quantity in which the rates of backend contractor are lower side, the PSU margin will further reduce.
c) PSU has raised the bill for an item having quantity of 75 nos. whereas
during site visit it was found that only 72 nos. quantity was available at
site. Also, 8 out of these 72 items were not found in working condition.
24. Intensive Examination Reports in respect of above cases have been forwarded to
CEOs and CVOs of the organisations for furnishing action taken reports.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024 201
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Appendix-V
(Para 5.10)
CASES ARISING OUT OF INTENSIVE EXAMINATIONS AND TAKEN UP FOR
DETAILED VIGILANCE INVESTIGATIONS BY THE RESPECTIVE CVO
1. In an Infrastructure project costing around Rs. 1148 crore, following major
irregularities were observed :-
a) Bid for appointment of the Project Management Consultant was submitted
by two firms by forming a Joint Venture (JV). Being highest scorer in the
Quality cum Cost Based Selection, ‘Letter of Intent’ was issued to the JV;
however, the contract agreement was signed with one of the members of
JV and payment was also being released to that firm. This is a vitiation in
the bidding process.
b) Six number of personnel of the team of the Project Management
Consultant are designated as Key Personnel including a Team Leader.
Permissible replacement of Key Personnel was limited to not more than
three (out of six Key Personnel). The consultancy contract further provides
that replacement of the Team Leader will ordinarily be not permitted
and any replacement may lead to termination of consultancy contract.
In this case, not only three other Key Personnel were replaced, but the
Team Leader was also not in place for a long time as the person proposed
as replacement was not acceptable to the organisation. Thus, the basic
contract terms were breached, but no action was taken against the
consultancy firm. Nonetheless, serious quality compromises and delay
took place in the execution of the work, which could be attributed to the
absence of the Team Leader and undue replacement of Key Personnel.
c) The concession was awarded to the consortium of two firms. The
consortium was qualified in technical capacity based on the past experience
of one firm only. After award of concession, SPV was formed and SPV
further entrusted the construction work on EPC basis to the partner of the
consortium, whose credentials were not even examined. Entire work was
being executed by this firm and the consortium partner based on whose
credentials for past experience, the consortium was qualified was absent
202 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
from the execution of the work. Thus, the entire work under this contract
was being executed by firm, whose credentials for such high value work
were not even established. Nonetheless, serious quality compromises and
delay took place in execution of the work, which could be attributed to the
lack of experience of the firm actually executing the work.
d) As per the concession agreement, the selection or replacement of EPC
contractor and execution of EPC contract was to be subject to the prior
approval of the Public Authority from the national security and public
interest perspective. However, such approval of the Public Authority was
neither obtained by the Concessionaire while employing EPC contractor
nor insisted by the Public Authority.
2. In an Infrastructure project costing around Rs. 911 crore, following major
irregularities were observed:-
a) During evaluation of the bids for appointment of Independent Engineer
(IE) for Operation & Maintenance of the project facility, the organisation
requested the concessionaire to give their consent for the bidders before
opening of the financial bids. The concessionaire informed that one of
the bidders is working as the Project Management Consultant (PMC)
in one of their EPC Contract and there they have certain disputes with
them. The Tender Committee considered the bid of this participating
bidder as non-responsive on the ground of ‘conflict of interest’ with the
concessionaire in their earlier project and rejected their bid. This bidder
raised objection for treating their bid as non-responsive. They submitted
that the concessionaire, as contractor in the said EPC contract, had
requested for grant of Provisional Commercial Operation Date (PCOD)
and as PMC, they had referred the matter to the Authority informing
about the poor condition of the road and advised for issue of PCOD only
after rectification of prevalent defects. As such, their actions as Authority
Engineer in the said EPC contract should not be construed as ‘conflict of
interest’ in the present case. This bidder further contended that if such
contention of the concessionaire is accepted, it will imply that discharge
of duties by the PMCs can always be construed as ‘conflict of interest’
and in such a situation, it will not be possible for PMCs to discharge their
duties objectively and impartially.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 203
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
b) The scheduled date of completion of the project was 20.05.2020 and
provisional completion was recorded on 18.11.2019 with a list of pending
works. These pending works were critical and necessary for smooth and
safe operation of project facility. Thus, the PCOD should not have been
issued. Because of delay in completing these pending works, final COD
could only be recorded on 26.08.2022. Notwithstanding the issue of
prematurely granting provisional completion, bonus was also paid to the
concessionaire, taking the date of completion as 18.11.2019.
3. In an infrastructure project costing around Rs. 1082 crore, following major
irregularities were observed :-
a) As per concession agreement, total 113.18 km project highway length was
to be developed for a design speed of 100 km/hr & minimum speed of
80km/hr. Out of total project length rolling terrain is 78.4 km and hilly
terrain is 34.78 km. Therefore, design speed for 78.4 km stretch should
have been 100 km/hr, but design speed of 100 km/hr was provided only
at 7.26 km length. Design speed of 80 km/hr was provided in 53.35 km
length. Similarly, design speed for hilly terrain should have been 60 km/
hr but it was observed that for a length of 11.43 km, design speed was up
to 55 km/hr. Design speed for 1.22 km was even less than 40 km/hr. It is
a major deviation in the concessionaire agreement and compromise with
the safety of road users. So many accidents occurred on the highway and
lesser design speed could be one of the reasons for accidents.
b) Eight locations were proposed in concessionaire agreement for
improvement of curves for design speed of 100 Km/hr, but not improved.
Geometric design of various Vehicular Under Pass (VUP), Pedestrian Under
Pass (PUP) etc. were designed based on design speed of 40 Km/hr, 50 Km/
hr, 55 km/hr, 60 km/hr, 70 km/hr, 80 km/hr & 100 Km/hr. Thus, the design
speed of six laning project was compromised by providing geometric
design of various VUP, PUP with lesser speed. Thus, it is a deviation from
the concession agreement and jeopardizing the safety of road users.
c) From the details of 46 structures provided during intensive examination,
it is observed that approaches of structures were constructed which allow
the vehicle speed of 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80 & 100 Km/hr. Approaches of 15
204 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
structures, out of 46 were not constructed as per Manual of Specifications
& Standards for Six Laning of Highways through Public Private Partnership
[IRC: SP:87-2013]. Thus, not only the undue benefit gone to the
concessionaire by providing lesser approaches of VUP, PUP but the safety
of road users was also compromised.
d) The existing 4 lane highway was to be developed for 6 laning as per
Manual for Specifications of 6 laning highway project [IRC: 87:2013]. It
was observed that horizontal and vertical profile of existing four lane road
was not corrected, resulting in 7 to 8 speed variations from 35 Km/hr to
100 Km/hr provided within one Km length, against design speed of 100
Km/hr. It became an accident-prone area and jeopardising the safety of
road users.
e) Scope of work includes rehabilitation, upgradation and widening of the
existing carriageway to six lane standards with construction of new pavement
and rehabilitation of existing pavement, and operation & maintenance.
During the pre-bid meeting, one prospective bidder asked that they
understand that entire existing carriageway other than reconstruction,
shall be strengthened with overlay but organisation offered no comments
on it. Therefore, it was clear that the entire existing carriageway was
to be strengthened by concessionaire. However, special repair work of
Rs. 33.05 crore was executed on entire stretch by organisation through
another agency. This work was completed after inviting RFP. Appointed
date of concessionaire agreement was fixed immediate after the expiry of
defect liability period of special repair work carried out after inviting RFP.
Thus, undue benefit gone to the concessionaire by carrying out special
repair of project highway, otherwise which was to be carried out by the
concessionaire.
4. In a contract for Hiring of 100 nos. Tractor- Trailers (TTs) for transportation
of ISO freight containers costing around Rs. 105.62 crore, following major
irregularities were observed:-
a) The contract was awarded @ Rs 157/- per Twenty foot Equivalent Unit
(TEU) for supplying 80TTs with a provision to extend the contract for three
years and further for two years. Later, a supplementary work order was
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 205
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
placed for additional 20 TTs for a period of three years. The firm served
notice after one year of operation for invoking Exit Clause from the
contract and exited from the contract. To avoid operational inconvenience,
subsequently with the approval of the Board, the organisation placed two
interim work orders, initially for a period of six months at a rate of Rs.
225/- per TEU and further for a period of another six months at a rate of
Rs. 255/- per TEU on the same firm. Due to not taking timely action by the
organisation to award new contract for hiring of TTs and not handling the
contract properly, the time extension was given twice at higher rate to the
same firm.
b) In the next tender, the organisation issued Work Order @ Rs 243/- per
TEU for hiring 100 TTs. The contract period for the tender was for a period
of three years with a provision for extension on mutual consent in two
spells of three years and two years at the same rate, terms and conditions
except escalation/ de-escalation on account of diesel and another
escalation on account of manpower at the beginning of each extension.
For the extension of contract, firm demanded higher rates i.e. @ Rs. 350/-
per TEU which was 44% higher than the then existing rate of work order.
The PSU negotiated the rate with the firm and extended the contract @
Rs. 340/- per TEU. However, after considering the price variation for the
escalation of input price on account of diesel and manpower, the contract
updated rate was Rs 282.21/- per TEU. However, no justification was
recorded for acceptance of rate of Rs. 340/- per TEU while checking the
rate reasonability. Also, the diesel base rate was indicated in the extended
contract with base date as mentioned in the original contract instead of
the date on which the contract was extended. This caused concomitant
gain to the contractor and financial loss to the organisation.
c) Prior to extending the existing contract, an open tender was floated with
short notification (07 days’ notice) for selection of vendor for hiring the
services of 45 TTs. Two bidders participated in the tender. One offer was
found non-responsive because of not meeting the minimum qualifying
criteria. Tender was discharged since the rate received was on the higher
side from existing contractor (single responsive bidder). It was observed
206 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
that 11 firms were shortlisted by the organisation for calling such short
dated tender, however, no copies of the bidding document were sent to
these firms for competitive bidding.
5. In a work related to finalizing Rate contract for the supply, implementation
and maintenance of smart meters of Advance Metering Infrastructure (AMI)
communication system costing around Rs. 27.97 crore, following major
irregularities were observed :-
a) There was a delay in submission of Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG)
for more than 4 months & also validity of PBG submitted was of short
duration for a period of 1 month. But no punitive action was taken as per
the contract conditions for delay in submission of PBG and acceptance of
PBG with less validity.
b) The Validity of PBG was required to be extended in case of extension of
the contract. It was observed that delivery period of the contract was
extended, but extension of validity of PBG was not sought accordingly.
6. In an EPC contract for the supply, installation, testing & commissioning of a
Wind Power project, including operation and maintenance (O&M), costing
around Rs. 335 crore, following major irregularities were observed: -
a) As per eligibility and qualifying requirements, the bidder should be
a manufacturer of Wind Electric Generators (WEG). However, it was
observed that successful bidder was not an OEM of WEG. Further, there
was no provision in the contract regarding penalizing the contractor for
losses in generation on account of shortfall in generation with respect
to guaranteed power generation of the whole plant during O&M. This
resulted in huge loss of revenue for the organization and the organization
is unable to pin down the contractor on account of this due to deficient
contract conditions.
b) The total shortfall in generation per year on average basis was approx.
30% of the guaranteed generation. The contractor failed to achieve the
guaranteed 95% Net Estimated Energy Generation (NEEG) even after 05
years. The organisation suffered financial loss due to less generation.
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 207
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
c) The O&M of the WEGs installed for the organisation is to be maintained by
the contractor for 10 years, however, there are no dedicated maintenance
staff, spare parts/ tools & tackles of the contractor for O&M of WEGs which
could be major reason for lapses in maintenance and less availability of
windmills that leads to less generation and revenue loss to the organisation.

CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
Appendix-VI
(Para 5.11)
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS UNDERTAKEN DURING THE YEAR, CONSEQUENT TO
CTEO’S OBSERVATIONS MADE IN COURSE OF INTENSIVE EXAMINATION
1. In a contract pertaining to an organisation, it was observed during intensive
examination that M-20 grade cement concrete was prescribed in the RCC work
considering prevailing environmental exposure condition as ‘mild’. The site of
work was situated near by coastal area and as such, as per IS 456, it should have
been considered as falling under the category of ‘moderate’ exposure. Because
of anomaly in categorization in environmental exposure conditions, lower grade
of concrete was used in the work whereas it should have been M-25 grade.
After CTEO observation, necessary instructions were issued to all concerned to
consider the right exposure conditions while deciding the grade of concrete to
be used in the work.
2. In an organisaion, the tender status on the e-procurement portal was reflected as
under “Technical evaluation’, whereas the tender had already been concluded.
After CTEO observation, systemic improvement was issued by the organisation
that in future updated status of processing of the tenders up to award of work
will be reflected on the e-procurement portal.
3. It was observed that Commercial Operation Date was fixed in highway projects
without ensuring the actual completion of all project activities. After CTEO
observation, a framework of various checks to be conducted at the time of
declaring successful completion of the project and permitting commercial use of
the project facility has been introduced.
4. In respect of an organization, the issue related to start of commercial operations
of highways without completing the median plantation work and thus adversely
affecting the safety of road users, was raised. After CTEO observation, a systemic
improvement has been issued by the organization to the effect that commercial
operation will only be started after completion of median plantation work.
5. In an organization, it was observed that the amount of test check of
measurements was not recorded anywhere in the measurement books and no
ANNUAL REPORT 2024 209
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
statement showing the quantum/ amount of test check done by the officers
was attached with the bills paid to the contractors. As such, it was not possible
to ascertain whether the officers concerned have test checked the quantum of
work corresponding to their responsibility. After CTEO observation, instructions
were issued for providing details of the test check i.e. amount of the test check
as well as details of measurement test checked by the respective officials.
6. In a work of an organisation, inordinate and unjustified delay in signing of the
agreement was observed. After CTEO observation, necessary amendment in the
organisation’s General Conditions of Contract (GCC) has been made for signing
of the agreement within reasonable time after the acceptance of the Letter of
Intent/ Award, and in any case before releasing the first running bill. It has also
been instructed now that the contract agreement shall be signed by a person
duly authorized/ empowered by the successful bidder.
7. In an organisation, there was no provision for elimination of the highest bidder
(H1) in e-Reverse Auction (e-RA) policy, as a result, bidders were quoting
arbitrarily high rates. After CTEO observation, e-RA policy has been revised with
specific reference to elimination criteria as well as provision contained in the
Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order, 2012
and Public Procurement (Preference to Make-in-India) Order, 2017 as amended
from time to time.
8. In an organisation, documents of the successful bidder were verified by the officers
after issuing a letter of award. The organisation did not have any mechanism
to deal with the cases, wherein the documents of the successful bidder were
found forged/manipulated after the award. After CTEO observation, a systemic
improvement has been issued by the organiation to verify the documents at the
time of bid evaluation.
9. In an organisation, the last purchase rate was escalated by flat 5% without
considering variation in indices and that too up to the tentative delivery period
to prepare estimate. After CTEO observation, the organisation issued a systemic
improvement to consider the various indices issued by Government of India
in preparation of estimate and escalation to be done only up to the date of
estimation/date of tender publication.
210 ANNUAL REPORT 2024
CENTRAL VIGILANCE COMMISSION
10. For evaluation of the bids received against a tender for hiring of manpower
services, Purchase Advisory Committee (PAC)/ Technical Evaluation Committee
(TEC) was constituted having seven members. It was observed that Technical as
well as Financial Evaluation Reports were not signed by all the members of TEC/
PAC. After CTEO observation, the organization has issued systemic improvement
in this regard.
11. While carrying out intensive examination of a contract drawn by an organisation
pertaining to supply, erection, testing and commissioning of boiler, it was
observed that the Procurement Manual of the organisation being followed was
last updated way back in 2015. After CTEO observation, the organisation updated
the procurement manual in 2024.
